2:32:41	here the offline was supposed to be there with two F's there we go	여기서 오프라인은 거기에 두 개의 F와 함께 우리는 간다
2:32:46	and right now if you reload the page you can notice that it's hard to see the	지금 페이지를 새로고침하면 보기가 어렵다는 것을 알 수 있습니다
2:32:51	icon but it's there so let's provide some styling so we can see it more	아이콘이 있지만 여기에 있으므로 제공하겠습니다. 우리가 더 볼 수 있도록 약간의 스타일링
2:32:55	clearly let's give it a class name equal to BG Dash white also width is going to	분명히 클래스 이름을 동일하게 지정합시다. BG Dash 흰색도 너비가 될 것입니다.
2:33:02	be 9 and height is going to be 9. if I save this nothing is happening yet let's	9이고 높이는 9가 됩니다. 만약 내가 아직 아무 일도 일어나지 않아 저장하자

2:33:51	higher opacity that's a great trick to visualize that specific hover effect so	더 높은 불투명도는 훌륭한 트릭입니다. 특정 호버 효과를 시각화하여
2:33:56	we talked about this stop propagation thing right now if we click on the image	우리는 이 정지 전파에 대해 이야기했습니다. 지금 당장 이미지를 클릭하면
2:34:01	anywhere on the image we're gonna go to that specific pin detail page	우리가 갈 이미지의 아무 곳이나 특정 핀 세부 정보 페이지
2:34:07	but if we click here on top left that is this button but	하지만 여기를 클릭하면 왼쪽 상단에는 이 버튼이 있지만

2:34:19	the image as well and we can see that clearly if we comment out the stop	이미지뿐만 아니라 우리는 그것을 볼 수 있습니다 우리가 중지를 주석 처리하면 명확하게
2:34:23	propagation line now if you reload the page and click on this button you can	당신이 다시 장전하면 지금 전파선 페이지에서 이 버튼을 클릭하면
2:34:29	see that the image does get downloaded but we can see we got redirected to pin	이미지가 다운로드되는지 확인하십시오 하지만 우리는 핀으로 리디렉션되었음을 알 수 있습니다.
2:34:34	detail and that's not necessarily what the user wants so if you simply put the	세부 사항 및 반드시 그런 것은 아닙니다 사용자가 원하기만 하면
2:34:40	stop propagation that means that the click is going to happen and it's going	전파를 중지한다는 것은 클릭이 발생하고 진행됩니다.
2:34:44	to disappear it's not going to propagate further through the image great so if we	사라지면 전파되지 않습니다 이미지를 통해 더 나아가 우리가
2:34:49	now reload the page go ahead and click the download button it only downloads	이제 페이지를 새로고침하고 클릭하세요. 다운로드 버튼만 다운로드
2:34:54	the image and if we open it up we can see the image in its full Glory	이미지를 열면 완전한 영광의 이미지를보십시오
2:35:00	great so now let's add all of the other necessary buttons like save and also go	이제 다른 모든 항목을 추가해 보겠습니다. 저장 및 이동과 같은 필수 버튼
2:35:06	to the URL we also need to provide the author of each specific post great	우리는 또한 제공해야 하는 URL에 각 특정 게시물의 작성자
2:35:12	now below this div let's check if the user has already saved that icon	이제 이 div 아래에서 사용자가 이미 해당 아이콘을 저장했습니다
2:35:18	in that case we can do something like already saved which is a variable we	이 경우 우리는 다음과 같이 할 수 있습니다. 이미 저장되어 있는 변수입니다.
2:35:23	haven't yet created question mark Dot and then we're gonna do linked right	아직 물음표 점을 만들지 않았습니다 그런 다음 링크를 올바르게 수행하겠습니다.
2:35:28	here and if the length is not equal to zero that means that the user has	여기에서 길이가 다음과 같지 않은 경우 0은 사용자가
2:35:33	already saved that specific post so with the ternary operator we can simply	이미 특정 게시물을 저장했기 때문에 삼항 연산자 우리는 단순히
2:35:38	display some kind of button so let's create a button and for now I'm simply	일종의 버튼을 표시합니다. 버튼을 만들고 지금은 단순히
2:35:43	going to say save there but if the user hasn't already saved the	거기에 저장을 말할거야 그러나 사용자가 아직 저장하지 않은 경우
2:35:47	post in that case we need to show a different button right here and that	이 경우 게시해야 합니다. 여기 저기 다른 버튼
2:35:53	button is going to say just save because the user hasn't already saved that	버튼에 저장이라고 표시될 것입니다. 사용자가 아직 저장하지 않았습니다.
2:35:58	specific post great but the question is how are we going to get access to this	특정 게시물은 훌륭하지만 질문은 우리는 어떻게 이것에 접근할 것인가
2:36:04	already saved variable and the answer might be simpler than you	이미 저장된 변수 그리고 그 대답은 당신보다 더 간단할 수 있습니다
2:36:09	think first we have to get access to our user variable and we can get the user	먼저 액세스 권한을 얻어야 한다고 생각합니다. 사용자 변수와 우리는 사용자를 얻을 수 있습니다
2:36:15	from local storage and I'm sure we've done that so far so let's just search	로컬 저장소에서 여기까지 했으니 검색해보자
2:36:19	for user or more specifically let's search for	사용자를 위해 또는 더 구체적으로
2:36:23	local storage dot get item and right here we are	로컬 스토리지 아이템을 얻고 바로 여기에 있습니다.
2:36:28	fetching our user great so we could easily just take this line right here	우리가 할 수 있도록 사용자를 훌륭하게 가져옵니다. 쉽게 여기이 라인을 타고
2:36:34	go back to our pin and paste it here and that would immediately give us access to	핀으로 돌아가서 여기에 붙여넣고 그것은 우리에게 즉시 액세스를 제공합니다
2:36:39	our user but as you can notice in that case we would be reusing this line to or	우리의 사용자지만 당신이 알 수 있듯이 이 줄을 재사용하거나
2:36:45	potentially more times and now this is the perfect opportunity to turn this	잠재적으로 더 많은 시간과 지금은 이것을 뒤집을 절호의 기회
2:36:50	into a utility function so let's go ahead and go into our utils and let's	유틸리티 함수로 이동합니다. 계속해서 유틸리티로 이동하여
2:36:56	create a new function called Fetch user.js inside of here let's say export	Fetch라는 새 함수를 만듭니다. 여기 내부의 user.js가 내보내기라고 가정 해 봅시다.

2:37:08	any parameters we're going to paste the line we just	모든 매개변수 우리는 우리가 방금 한 줄을 붙여 넣을 것입니다
2:37:12	copied and the only thing we're going to do is say return user info	복사되고 우리가 할 유일한 것은 사용자 정보를 반환하는 것입니다.
2:37:19	great so now we can go back to our home component we can delete this long line	이제 우리는 우리 집으로 돌아갈 수 있습니다. 이 긴 줄을 삭제할 수 있는 구성 요소
2:37:24	and we can simply say fetch user and that's it we call it like this the only	우리는 단순히 사용자 가져오기라고 말할 수 있고 그게 바로 우리가 이것을 이렇게 부르는 것뿐입니다.
2:37:30	thing we have to do of course is imported so we can press Ctrl space and	우리가 당연히 해야 할 일은 가져오기를 수행하여 Ctrl 스페이스를 누르고
2:37:35	import fetch user from utils and that's it we made this so much simpler	utils에서 가져오기 사용자 가져오기 우리는 이것을 훨씬 더 간단하게 만들었습니다.
2:37:41	of course now not only can we simplify that but we can also go to our pin	물론 이제 단순화할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 하지만 우리는 또한 우리 핀으로 갈 수 있습니다
2:37:46	component and repeat the process that's going to be fetch user	구성 요소를 만들고 프로세스를 반복합니다. 가져오기 사용자가 될 것입니다
2:37:51	like this and then we simply have to import it	이와 같이 그런 다음 가져오기만 하면 됩니다.
2:37:55	straight from the utils let's see there we go fetch user great so now we have	유틸리티에서 바로 봅시다. 우리는 좋은 사용자를 가져 오기 위해 이동합니다. 그래서 이제 우리는
2:38:02	access to the user info in this case let's simply call it user now that we	이 경우 사용자 정보에 대한 액세스 이제 사용자라고 부르겠습니다.
2:38:07	have access to the user we have to figure out if the user has already saved	우리가 해야 하는 사용자에 대한 액세스 권한이 있습니다. 사용자가 이미 저장했는지 확인

2:38:45	that the user definitely already saved the post because we looped over the	사용자가 이미 저장한 우리가 반복했기 때문에 게시물
2:38:50	saved posts and as you can see his Google ID is already there in the people	저장된 게시물과 당신이 볼 수 있듯이 Google ID는 이미 사람들에게 있습니다.

2:39:05	variable from the pin and then just refer to it like this now let's optimize	핀에서 변수를 선택한 다음 이제 이것을 최적화하자.
2:39:10	our already saved or saved filter functionality there's a few things that	이미 저장되었거나 저장된 필터 기능
2:39:15	I want to teach you that are just a bit Advanced but I'm sure you're gonna find	나는 당신에게 그것을 조금 가르치고 싶습니다 고급이지만 당신이 찾을 것이라고 확신합니다
2:39:19	them useful let's think about of how the filter function Works let's say that the	유용합니다. 필터 기능 작동
2:39:24	user's ID is one and let's also say that the array of people who like the post is	사용자의 ID는 하나이며 게시물을 좋아하는 사람들의 배열은

2:39:36	case if we apply the filter and if you're searching for item that posted by	필터를 적용하면 님이 게시한 항목을 찾고 있습니다.
2:39:41	is equal to user Google ID in that case this filter is going to return just the	이 경우 사용자 Google ID와 같습니다. 이 필터는

2:40:19	into parentheses and then at the end we can get the dot length of that array so	괄호 안에 넣은 다음 마지막에 해당 배열의 점 길이를 얻을 수 있으므로
2:40:25	now if we try doing that length of this then we're going to get one	이제 이 길이만큼 하려고 하면 그럼 우리는 하나를 얻을거야

3:51:09	input right here to be text we can add a placeholder	
3:51:14	to be something like add a comment we also need to provide a value which is	-
3:51:20	going to be the comment itself and finally we have to say the on change	-
3:51:25	is going to have of course a callback function where we get the event and then	-
3:51:31	we can set the comment to be equal to event dot Target dot value now if we	-
3:51:38	save this you can see this nice comment input that gets this nice border when	-
3:51:43	you click it and we have our profile icon our profile icon is not centered in	-
3:51:49	this case so let's change this link just a bit we won't need any class names on	-
3:51:55	our link tag so you can delete that	-
3:51:59	and we'll need just a few classes on our image tag W can be set to 8 as well as	-
3:52:06	the height can be set to 8 rounded Dash full is fine and instead of object hover	-
3:52:13	we can simply say cursor Dash pointer	-
3:52:19	there we go now it's nicely visible right here and finally how do we post a	-
3:52:24	comment well we need a button so just below this input right here I'm going to	-
3:52:31	add a button this button is going to be of a type is	-
3:52:36	equal to button it's going to have a class name equal to	-
3:52:42	BG Dash red Dash 500. it's going to have a text Dash White	-
3:52:49	rounded Dash full padding X-6 padding Y dash 2 font Dash semi bold text Dash	-
3:53:00	base and outline Dash none and if we are adding the comment so	-
3:53:08	right here we have that state of adding comment	
3:53:11	if we are adding the comment then we can say posting the comment dot dot else we	-
3:53:19	can set posted great and finally what would a button be	-
3:53:25	without an on click property so we can say on click add comment	-
3:53:32	great so our last thing we have to do for this specific file is to add the add	-
3:53:38	comment functionality so let's scroll up just above the fetch bin details we can	-
3:53:46	say const add comment and if we do have a comment then we're gonna call our	-
3:53:52	client our sanity client and we're going to call the dot patch method because we	-
3:53:59	want to patch a specific pin and if we don't have any comments	-
3:54:04	already we want to set if missing in that case we can set the comments to be	-
3:54:10	equal to an empty array then we can insert a comment after	-
3:54:17	meaning at the end comments and then square brackets minus	-
3:54:22	one that means at the end and then we can insert an array where we're going to	-
3:54:28	have our comment the comment has to have a key let's put this into multiple lines	-
3:54:34	like this there we go so comment we have the underscore key is	-
3:54:40	equal to uuid version four we call it as a function that's going to give each	-
3:54:47	comment a specific ID we also want to add the posted by because we need to	-
3:54:52	know who created that comment so we have the underscore type is equal to posted	-
3:54:58	by and we also have the underscore ref is	
3:55:02	equal to user dot underscore ID great we already learned that after we insert	-
3:55:09	something we have to dot committed we have to commit our insertion and then	-
3:55:15	after it is committed that returns a promise so we can call a DOT then	-
3:55:21	and we can fetch all of the pin details again	
3:55:25	then we can also set the comment field to be equal to an empty array to reset	-
3:55:31	it and we can set the state of set adding comment to be set to false	-
3:55:37	before adding the comment let's reload our page	-
3:55:42	let's see why does our button say posted let's think about it the posted state is	-
3:55:49	here at the bottom oh right here instead of posted we	-
3:55:55	simply need to say post there we go that that is looking better	-
3:56:00	and let's comment something like what a lovely kitten for this post and click	-
3:56:05	post posting the comment the page reloaded	
3:56:09	and now we have one comment of course this doesn't look that good JavaScript	-
3:56:14	Mastery comments on their own post but the comment is definitely there that's	-
3:56:20	awesome the last thing we have to do for our pin Details page is we have to show	-
3:56:26	all of the related posts to this one that's going to give it more of a social	-
3:56:31	media application feel because you can get lost in all of the Cats images as	-
3:56:36	people do on all of the other social media channels	-
3:56:40	so at the full end below the last div we're going to open a dynamic block and	-
3:56:46	say if pins question mark dot length is greater than zero in that case that's	-
3:56:52	going to say more like this now just after this last div let's open a dynamic	-
3:56:58	block of code check if pins exist and in that case we can render a react fragment	-
3:57:06	like this in that react fragment we're going to show an H2 tag with a class	-
3:57:12	name equal to text Dash Center also font dashboard	-
3:57:20	text-2xl margin top is going to be set to 8 and margin bottom is going to be	-
3:57:26	set to 4. and inside of that H2 we can say something like more like this	-
3:57:33	of course our ternary also has to have an else so right here if we don't have	-
3:57:38	any pins we can simply show a spinner that's going to contain a message	-
3:57:45	loading more pins like that there we go	-
3:57:51	and as you can see right now since we have this div and something next to it	-
3:57:56	we're not wrapping that into anything more so we have to wrap this at the	-
3:58:02	start with an empty react fragment and then we also have to close it at the	-
3:58:08	end right here we have to close that empty	
3:58:12	react fragment there we go so now we have more like this so let's go ahead	-
3:58:18	and actually show those pins and the process for that is going to be	-
3:58:22	incredibly simple the only thing we have to do is call our masonry layout	-
3:58:27	component and pass the prop pins is equal to pins	-
3:58:33	there we go and as soon as we added our masonry grid you can see that	-
3:58:38	unfortunately nothing is here and it's possible that we don't have any pins so	-
3:58:44	let's go ahead and actually cancel the log depends	-
3:58:48	console.log pins	-
3:58:52	open up the inspect element console	
3:58:57	and you can see it's currently an array of zero so right here instead of pins we	-
3:59:03	can say pins.length is greater than zero only in that case do we want to show	-
3:59:09	more like this else we're simply going to show loading more pins	-
3:59:15	so to be able to show more related pins they have to be of the same category so	-
3:59:21	let's go back to the create a pin one more time and I'm going to add one more	-
3:59:26	CAD image of my setup	-
3:59:31	there we go I've inputted all the data and the pin is ready to be saved let's	-
3:59:36	go ahead and create it there we go now we have three images in	-
3:59:42	our grid let's go to our second image and right now this breaks so let's go	-
3:59:49	ahead and see where is the issue I'm going to inspect go to console and let's	-
3:59:55	see where the issue occurred we first have a few warnings warnings	-
4:00:02	warning but let's see so can a 3D property dot length of null at the start	-
4:00:07	pins is going to be set to null so of course we have to add a question mark	-
4:00:12	right here as soon as we do that everything loads	-
4:00:16	properly and we can see more like this and another image from that same	-
4:00:20	category that is great I've also noticed that we are improperly	-
4:00:27	cutting this destination right here so let's go to pin	-
4:00:32	which is going to be in the components pin and let's search for our destination	-
4:00:40	there we go destination and I don't think we need to cut	-
4:00:45	anything from 8 onwards that is only if we're starting with https colon forward	-
4:00:52	slash but in this case I'm just starting with JS Mastery pro.com so we don't have	-
4:00:58	to cut anything let's go ahead and remove this	-
4:01:03	so it doesn't have to be sliced at all and same thing here I'm just going to	-
4:01:09	try and leave the entire thing right here so that's going to be simply	-
4:01:13	destination and there we go as you can see this looks good now but if we go	-
4:01:19	back to home the first link is going to be cut out so we definitely need to cut	-
4:01:24	it out so destination.length is longer than let's do 15 characters in that case	-
4:01:30	we're going to show a template string of destination	
4:01:35	and then dot slice let's start from 0 to 15. and we can add three dots right here	-
4:01:43	else if it's shorter than 15 we're going to show the entire destination	-
4:01:49	and as you can see now it's cut out properly and these two look great	-
4:01:55	awesome I can notice that there's a typo here but in this case it doesn't really	-
4:02:00	matter this is looking great now let's try to expand this a bit	-
4:02:05	as you can see all of the images are currently of the same height but if they	-
4:02:10	were of a different height then we would see the full power of that masonry grid	-
4:02:14	but this is looking great as well with that said we are done with the pin	-
4:02:20	Details page that's looking great so our next thing to implement is going to be	-
4:02:27	the user profile to implement the user profile we can go	-
4:02:32	back to home check out all of our routes and you're	-
4:02:37	gonna notice the user profile I have a typo here profile there we go and then	-
4:02:43	the dynamic URL to the user ID and that's rendering the user profile	-
4:02:48	component so let's go to the user profile and we're going to implement it	-
4:02:53	right here as always let's start by importing all of the necessary packages	-
4:02:59	and dependencies so we can get the use State as well as the use effect hooks we	-
4:03:07	are also going to import an icon AI outline	
4:03:12	and that's going to be a log out that's going to be coming from react	-
4:03:18	Dash icons AI then we can also import the use params and use navigate	-
4:03:26	these are the hooks coming from react Dash router Dash Dom	-
4:03:32	and we can also import the Google logout yep that's a special component created	-
4:03:40	by the react dash Google Dash login package	
4:03:45	we're going to also import a few things of our own so that's going to be user	-
4:03:51	created pins query as well as the user query	
4:03:56	itself and also user saved pins query and these are coming from dot slash	-
4:04:04	utils forward slash data we are also going to import client from dot slash	-
4:04:12	client that's our sanity client also the masonry grid component or masonry layout	-
4:04:20	so that's going to be import masonry layout from dot slash	-
4:04:25	masonry layout and at the end we're going to import the spinner component	-
4:04:32	from dot slash spinner or user profile is also going to have a few use States	-
4:04:39	so it might be a good idea to create them right away	-
4:04:43	the first use state is going to be user and set user and at the start it's going	-
4:04:49	to be set to null then we're going to have the pins state so we can say pins	-
4:04:55	as well as the set pins and that's going to be set to null as well and then we	-
4:05:01	can have the text so your state is going to be text and set text and it's going	-
4:05:08	to say created this is going to be either created	-
4:05:13	or saved because we're going to switch between these two states then we have to	-
4:05:18	have one more state which is going to be active BTN we're always going to have	-
4:05:25	one active button and at the start that's going to be the created button we	-
4:05:31	also want to declare the navigate function is equal to use navigate and we	-
4:05:37	also need to get the user ID from the params as you can see right here so we	-
4:05:42	can say const in curly braces user ID is equal to use params	-
4:05:50	great now of course at the start we're gonna	
4:05:55	check if the user doesn't yet exist in that case we're going to return a	-
4:06:01	spinner component like this and we're gonna have the	-
4:06:05	message say loading profile like that let's save that and as you can see right	-
4:06:14	now the only thing we'll be able to see is the loading profile	-
4:06:18	so of course we have to create a use effect right here	-
4:06:22	and that use effect is going to fetch our user data	-
4:06:26	so in this use effect we're going to call this whenever the user ID changes	-
4:06:33	and we need to set up our query which is going to be equal to user query with the	-
4:06:39	user ID and then we can use the same old client.fetch pass in the query	-
4:06:47	create a DOT then get the data about that specific user and simply set the	-
4:06:54	user to be equal to data 0 because we're getting an array and we only want the	-
4:07:00	first user if we reload we can just for a second see loading and then	-
4:07:05	immediately user profile and now is actually the time to implement the jsx	-
4:07:11	for that user profile let's add a class name equal to relative	-
4:07:18	padding bottom 2 H dash full justify Dash Center and items Dash Center inside	-
4:07:26	of that div we're going to have one more div and that div is going to have a	-
4:07:31	class name equal to flex Flex Dash column and padding bottom Dash 5. inside	-
4:07:38	of that div we're gonna have one more div which is going to have a class name	-
4:07:44	equal to relative Flex Flex Dash column and margin bottom	-
4:07:52	seven and trust me one final div right here	
4:07:56	which is going to have a class name equal to flex Flex Dash column justify	-
4:08:03	Dash Center and items Dash Center inside of this div we are going to have	-
4:08:09	an image tag this image is always going to fetch a random image from and splash	-
4:08:16	that's a page where you can find a lot of random images so at the top let's	-
4:08:21	create the URL for the random image and that's going to be https Colin	-
4:08:29	forward slash forward slash Source Dot unsplash.com	
4:08:35	in here we can do a forward slash and say 1 600 pixels or just 1600 and then	-
4:08:43	times 900. and then forward slash question mark	-
4:08:47	nature comma photography comma technology or of course you can	-
4:08:54	choose any category you want so this URL is going to give us a random	-
4:09:00	image now we can use this as a source to this	
4:09:04	image right here let's also provide it a class name equal	-
4:09:09	to W Dash full height Dash 370 on extra large devices we're going	-
4:09:16	to set the height to be equal to 510 Shadow Dash LG and object Dash cover	-
4:09:24	and finally we have to give it the alt is equal to Banner picture	-
4:09:30	or just Banner pick and there we go we got we couldn't find	-
4:09:35	that photo so let's go ahead and check out our random image URL one more time	-
4:09:40	it's supposed to be https column four slash forward slash Source Dot	-
4:09:47	unsplash.com and instead of the asterisk here this was supposed to be X there we	-
4:09:54	go so now if you save it again you're gonna get the random user banner and	-
4:09:59	this is going to change every time that you reload the page	-
4:10:03	below the banner photo we of course need the user's photo so right here we can	-
4:10:09	add the image tag we can add the class name equal to	-
4:10:14	rounded Dash full w-20 height Dash 20 minus margin top	-
4:10:21	minus 10 Shadow Dash XL and object dash cover okay so now we have to get the	-
4:10:28	source for this image and that's simply going to be user dot image as soon as we	-
4:10:34	save that you will be able to see your profile image we can add the alt tag	-
4:10:39	which is going to be user Dash pick now below that we have to add an H1 tag	-
4:10:45	which is going to have a class name equal to font Dash bold text Dash 3XL	-
4:10:53	text Dash Center and margin top 3. and inside of that H1 we're going to render	-
4:11:01	the user dot user name there we go now just below this H1 we're going to render	-
4:11:08	one div and that div is going to have a class name equal to Absolute it's also	-
4:11:15	going to be positioned at top 0 Z index to 1 right dash 0 and padding Dash 2.	-
4:11:22	inside of there we have to check if the user ID	-
4:11:27	is equal to user dot underscore ID in that case the user can also log out from	-
4:11:35	his profile so right here we're going to render the Google logout like this	-
4:11:42	and it's going to look almost the same as it does with our Google login so	-
4:11:48	let's go ahead and search for our Google login	
4:11:54	there we go I'm going to copy this entire component	-
4:11:58	here go back and simply paste it right here there we go the only thing we have	-
4:12:05	to do is rename it to Google log out and of course we're going to have to change	-
4:12:11	a few things the client ID is going to remain the same the button is still	-
4:12:16	going to be here but it's going to have a few different class names	-
4:12:21	the class names that it will have is going to be BG Dash White	-
4:12:26	p-2 rounded Dash full cursor Dash pointer	
4:12:33	outline Dash none and Shadow Dash MD it's going to have these two properties	-
4:12:40	as well and instead of this icon we're going to render a different icon right	-
4:12:44	here which is AI outline log out with a color equal to red as well as the font	-
4:12:52	size equal to 21 and we don't need these responses Google because we're simply	-
4:12:59	logging out the thing we do need is going to be on success but on log out	-
4:13:06	success and there we're going to call the logout function	-
4:13:12	of course we have to create this logout function I can do it just below our use	-
4:13:17	effect cons log out is an arrow function and the only thing it can do is simply	-
4:13:23	say local storage dot clear	-
4:13:28	and right here we can also navigate to forward slash login of course we're	-
4:13:33	going to do that if we just logged out and there you go at the top right you	-
4:13:38	can see this logout button I'm not gonna click it right now because I don't want	-
4:13:42	to get logged out but there it is feel free to test it out now below this div	-
4:13:48	containing our Google logout and Below one more div we can create a new div and	-
4:13:55	this is going to be div for R2 buttons right here this div is going to have a	-
4:14:02	class name equal to text Dash Center and also margin bottom seven here we can	-
4:14:09	have two different buttons let's go ahead and create the first one first	-
4:14:13	that's going to be a button it's going to have a type is equal to button	-
4:14:20	it's also going to have an on click property where it's going to get the	-
4:14:24	event and it's going to set the text to be	
4:14:29	equal to e dot Target dot text content so this is going to take the contents of	-
4:14:36	that button and then we can switch the set active vtn to be equal to created	-
4:14:44	based on that we can also change the class name	-
4:14:48	so this is the first time we're going to have a dynamic class name we're going to	-
4:14:52	say if active BTN is triple equal to created	
4:14:59	in that case we want to render the active BTN Styles else we want to render	-
4:15:05	the not active BTN Styles like this and of course these are	-
4:15:13	the two string variables which we're going to create right away so let's	-
4:15:17	scroll to the top of this component and right here at the top we can declare the	-
4:15:22	const active BTN styles are equal to BG Dash red Dash 500 text Dash white font	-
4:15:32	Dash bold p-2 rounded Dash full with Dash 20 and	-
4:15:40	outline Dash none now I'm going to duplicate this line and	-
4:15:45	this is going to be not active BTN Styles BG is not going to be red it's	-
4:15:52	going to be primary we're also going to add the margin write-4 text is not going	-
4:15:58	to be white it's going to be text Dash black and then everything else can	-
4:16:03	remain as it is now we can see our first button so if we scroll down we can of	-
4:16:09	course add something inside of that button something like created of course	-
4:16:14	this is going to refer to the posts that this user has created and we can	-
4:16:19	duplicate this entire button just below this button is going to do the same	-
4:16:24	thing but it's going to set active BTN to be saved and right here we're gonna	-
4:16:31	check if we're currently on the saved button and instead of created it's going	-
4:16:36	to say saved so now we can switch between these two buttons depending on	-
4:16:42	the state we we need to show the created posts or the saved posts so of course to	-
4:16:48	do that we're gonna have to have one new use effect which is going to handle	-
4:16:52	fetching the saved posts and the created posts	
4:16:56	so just below this use effect let's create a new one that's going to be use	-
4:17:00	effect it's going to have a callback function and a dependency array and it's	-
4:17:06	going to be recalled whenever the text changes or when the user ID changes	-
4:17:11	inside of here we want to check if the text is triple equal to created in that	-
4:17:18	case we want to get the created pins but we're also going to have an else	-
4:17:23	in that case we want to get the saved pins so let's first start by getting the	-
4:17:28	created ones const created pins query is equal to user created pins query and we	-
4:17:38	need to pass in the user ID then we can simply say client dot fetch	-
4:17:44	right here we're going to pass in the created pins query and we simply need to	-
4:17:50	call a DOT then we're going to get the data and the only	-
4:17:55	thing we need to do is say set pins is equal to data now we can copy this	-
4:18:02	entirely paste it below the only thing we have to change is right here this is	-
4:18:08	not going to be created pins query it's going to be saved	-
4:18:12	pins query and we're going to get saved pins by saying user	-
4:18:18	saved pins query and then we pass in the user ID everything else is going to	-
4:18:24	remain the same now that we have these queries we of course have to show our	-
4:18:29	posts so just below the div containing these two buttons I'm going to create	-
4:18:35	one more div and this div is going to have a class name	-
4:18:40	if we fix this properly there we go this div is going to have a class name equal	-
4:18:46	to padding X2 and inside of there we're simply going to render our own masonry	-
4:18:53	layout component and we're going to pass in the pins	-
4:18:58	now if we save that you're going to notice that JavaScript Mastery	-
4:19:02	successfully created three different pins now it might be a good idea to wrap	-
4:19:08	this inside of a ternary statement so saying only if there are pins dot length	-
4:19:13	or a question mark dot length in that case we can actually render out the	-
4:19:19	masonry layout including our pins so if somebody hasn't created any then we're	-
4:19:25	going to show something else so instead of using and we can turn this into	-
4:19:30	eternary and simply show a new div like this a div	-
4:19:36	that's going to say no pins found we can give that div a class name is	-
4:19:43	equal to flex justify Dash Center font Dash bold items Dash center with Dash	-
4:19:53	full text Dash XL and margin top 2. I don't think we'll be able to see this	-
4:19:59	because JavaScript Mastery both created posts and also save the post as you can	-
4:20:06	see right here and with that our profile page is now fully done let's expand it	-
4:20:12	and see it in its full Glory there we go as you can see we have our three posts	-
4:20:19	right here we can switch between saved and created and this Banner changes	-
4:20:25	every time with that said our profile page is now	-
4:20:29	fully done and it's looking great now I've noticed that the categories on the	-
4:20:35	left side are just still the mock categories or demo categories that we	-
4:20:39	created at the start so now that we have the list of actual categories we can	-
4:20:45	actually show them right there to do that we can go to our sidebar and	-
4:20:50	instead of actually creating mock categories like we have this ones we're	-
4:20:55	simply going to import categories	
4:20:58	and that's coming from dot slash utils forward slash data there we go so now as	-
4:21:06	you can see we're showing real categories right here and not only that	-
4:21:11	now we can actually show the image for each category so inside of the nav link	-
4:21:17	just above the category title we can right here show the image with a source	-
4:21:24	category dot image we can also give it a class name equal to w-8 height Dash 8	-
4:21:33	rounded Dash full and Shadow Dash SM let's also give it an ALT tag which is	-
4:21:41	going to be category and there we go now we even have the images for each one of	-
4:21:47	these categories so if you go to the home page and go to for example cats we	-
4:21:54	can see two different images right here but if we go to something like cars	-
4:21:59	you'll see that there is nothing there so it might be a good idea to go to our	-
4:22:05	pins our pins more specifically the feed page or the category page that is going	-
4:22:11	to be the feed component and right here we can check if there is no pins	-
4:22:19	question mark dot length in that case we can simply return an H2 that's going to	-
4:22:26	say no pins available and there we go you can see it right here	-
4:22:33	of course you can only see this right now but later on once your users	-
4:22:38	populate this page the images are going to be included in all of the categories	-
4:22:43	and the only thing you'll be able to see is this nice masonry grid with all of	-
4:22:48	the images so the create a post is done the actual pin Details page is also done	-
4:22:55	the profile page is now fully done as well what do we still have to do well if	-
4:23:01	you go to share me and click on search you'll notice that this search component	-
4:23:06	is still not done so the search is going to be our next step	-
4:23:12	to start working on the search component you can visit your file tree go to	-
4:23:17	components and then search inside of here let's start by importing	-
4:23:23	the use State as well as the use effect hooks from react	-
4:23:29	then we're going to import a few of our local files which is going to be import	-
4:23:35	masonry layout from dot slash masonry layout	
4:23:40	let's also import the client from dot dot slash client this is our	-
4:23:48	sanity client which we can use to connect to sanity's backend	-
4:23:53	then let's import the feed query as well as the search query	-
4:23:59	and these are coming from dot slash utils forward slash data	-
4:24:06	and finally we can import the spinner from dot slash spinner	-
4:24:13	great now let's try to see where are we calling our search component we can do	-
4:24:19	that by opening the first component bracket and then simply searching for	-
4:24:24	search and you can notice that we are calling	
4:24:28	it right here inside of the pins and that we're passing a search term to it	-
4:24:33	so let's go back to our search and we know that we're getting a search term as	-
4:24:38	a parameter or as a prop inside of here we can set two use States and in this	-
4:24:45	case that's going to be pins as well as the set pins at the start set to null	-
4:24:51	and then we also need the loading so I'm going to say use State and we're going	-
4:24:57	to set that to loading set loading and at the start it's going to be set to	-
4:25:01	false then inside of this div we're going to	
4:25:06	check if we're currently loading and if we are loading we're going to show a	-
4:25:11	spinner with a message equal to searching for pins	-
4:25:18	like this now if we turn this to true you can	-
4:25:22	notice that we have searching for pins right here we're going to write pins	-
4:25:28	question mark dot length and that is not equal to zero if that is true or meaning	-
4:25:34	if that is false we're going to Simply show The Masonry layout and we're going	-
4:25:39	to pass pins to it finally below that we're gonna do pins	-
4:25:44	question mark dot length is equal to zero and then in that case only if the	-
4:25:51	search term is also not empty meaning we are searching for something but there	-
4:25:57	are no pins in that case also and if we are not currently loading in that case	-
4:26:05	we're going to Simply display a div we can do it right here div that's going	-
4:26:13	to have a class name mt-10	
4:26:18	text Dash Center and text Dash XL there we can say no pins found	-
4:26:30	there we go but right now the question is how are we going to get the pins for	-
4:26:36	a specific search query and the answer is let's use a use effect	-
4:26:41	right here so let's write use effect	-
4:26:45	and that use effect is going to change anytime that the search term changes	-
4:26:53	we can first check if there is a search term	
4:26:58	in that case we can set the loading to be set to true	-
4:27:03	else if we don't have a search term then we can show the pins of all categories	-
4:27:09	in all Search terms so let's say client dot fetch	-
4:27:14	feed query and then we can simply say that then we	-
4:27:19	get the data and then we simply need to set pins	-
4:27:23	which is going to be data and also set loading which is going to be set to	-
4:27:30	false but if we do have a search term in that	
4:27:34	case we can say cons query is equal to search query where we're going to pass	-
4:27:41	the search term and we're going to pass the lowercased search term so we can say	-
4:27:47	dot to lower case and then right here we can basically	-
4:27:53	copy this client.fetch right here paste it below this query and instead of	-
4:28:00	feed query we're just going to pass this specific query	-
4:28:04	and there we go let's save it and test it out as you can see right now we can	-
4:28:11	see all of the posts but if I click search right here and	-
4:28:15	search for something like cats you can notice that now we get only the	-
4:28:21	cats if I try searching for something like coffee	-
4:28:26	there we go we can only see the image that contains the word coffee in the	-
4:28:31	title or in the description with that said our search is now fully	-
4:28:36	done that is great so I'm going to take some time and add a	-
4:28:42	few more photos of different heights just so we can see the full beauty of	-
4:28:46	our masonry layout and there we go I went ahead and added a	-
4:28:53	few more photos and now if I put it in this view you can see how we get this	-
4:28:58	nice masonry layout of course the more photos you add the better is it going to	-
4:29:04	look I've added two different wallpapers the logo for JavaScript Mastery as well	-
4:29:09	as the logo for the new JavaScript Mastery Pro platform	-
4:29:13	and there were the three images for my setup of course we can go to wallpaper	-
4:29:19	see all the related photos as well as the photo categories work cats work as	-
4:29:25	well the profile page is working perfectly as well we can save different	-
4:29:30	posts and everything is functioning perfectly	
4:29:34	of course the last touch is going to be to change the title and the favicon of	-
4:29:39	our website so let's collapse all the files and folders go to share me front	-
4:29:44	end go to public and into the index.html right here instead of the favicon we can	-
4:29:52	use our actual logo of course feel free to use any logo you want but the logo	-
4:29:57	for the share me platform is going to be linked in the description you'll be able	-
4:30:02	to find the link there it's going to be titled favicon.png and	-
4:30:07	as you can see right here the only thing we have to do is simply rename from	-
4:30:12	favicon.ico to favicon.png and if you do that and reload you can	-
4:30:19	see there is our new icon and we can also change the title of our website to	-
4:30:24	be something like share me	
4:30:28	great and if you look at that now we have	
4:30:32	share me and it is our photo sharing platform	
4:30:36	essentially a full stack social media application for sharing images	-
4:30:42	this is the website we've created from scratch together in this video	-
4:30:47	phenomenal job now you can see this is the website that	-
4:30:51	I created before and we have a few more images here so we can really see the	-
4:30:56	power of this masonry grid you can turn your app into a real social	-
4:31:01	media application where users will be able to post images just like these ones	-
4:31:06	now let's start with the last step of our journey and that is actually	-
4:31:11	deploying this entire website to the Internet so that all of your friends and	-
4:31:16	potential employers can see your website of course you'll also be able to share	-
4:31:22	it on your portfolio great let's start to deploy our great social media	-
4:31:28	platform we're gonna use netlify netlify is great for free and small projects	-
4:31:33	they don't give you a specific domain name but it's great if you simply want	-
4:31:37	to put something on the Internet on the other hand if you want extremely fast	-
4:31:42	hosting maybe you're planning to turn this into a real social media	-
4:31:46	application and you want to get a real domain name I would strongly encourage	-
4:31:51	you to look into hostinger they offer a free domain name with their value added	-
4:31:57	package the link to hostinger is going to be down in the description	-
4:32:01	but as I've mentioned for Simplicity purposes in this case we're going to go	-
4:32:06	with netlify you can log in at the top right you can click sites right here	-
4:32:12	this is where we're going to deploy our application before we can do that let's	-
4:32:17	go ahead and close all the files and folders	
4:32:20	I'm just holding Ctrl and pressing W to quickly close them	-
4:32:25	and we can collapse all the files and folders here as well now you can open up	-
4:32:30	share me frontend go to public and we'll have to add one	-
4:32:35	more file to the public folder the file's name is going to be underscore	-
4:32:39	redirect without an extension and there you'll have to type forward	-
4:32:45	slash asterisk space forward slash index dot HTML and then 200.	-
4:32:53	our website is a multi-page website so if we go to something like category	-
4:32:58	you'll see category cars and on netlify if you reload the page and you're not on	-
4:33:05	the root domain then it's going to throw you an error but with this that error is	-
4:33:09	going to be fixed so now we can actually deploy it but	-
4:33:14	first we have to build it out so let's open up our terminal by going to view	-
4:33:19	and then terminal and then we can stop our currently running terminal by	-
4:33:23	pressing Ctrl C and then y we can clear this and make sure that you are in the	-
4:33:29	share me front end or however you call the front-end part of your application	-
4:33:34	and finally you can run npm run build this is going to create an optimized	-
4:33:40	production build of our entire react application once your application builds	-
4:33:45	out you'll be able to find a build folder right here right click it and	-
4:33:51	click reveal in file explorer then you can go back to netlify find your folder	-
4:33:56	right here and then scroll down to this page and drag and drop it right inside	-
4:34:02	of here it's going to take just a second to upload and in a matter of seconds	-
4:34:07	it's going to be deployed on the web before checking it out you can quickly	-
4:34:12	change your domain name right here the netplify app is still going to remain	-
4:34:17	there but you can change just the start of that name so let's try with share me	-
4:34:22	JSM and save there we go now you can go to your domain name	-
4:34:29	and you'll notice that we are just going to get a loading page nothing more so	-
4:34:35	now is actually the time that we put our app to production	-
4:34:39	now that it is deployed we have to change some of the parameters with the	-
4:34:43	Google login as well as sanity so that everything is allowed for the production	-
4:34:48	version of our application the first thing you can do is go to your sandy.io	-
4:34:54	forward slash manage then find your project go to the settings more	-
4:35:00	specifically to the API settings course Origins and then copy the URL of your	-
4:35:06	newly deployed site I just copied it add course origin paste	-
4:35:12	it right here and allow credentials and save now that we've done that let's go	-
4:35:18	back to our website reload the page and right now we get cannot read property	-
4:35:23	null of Google ID and that is completely fine the reason why that is happening is	-
4:35:30	because we also have to provide our newly created URL to the Google console	-
4:35:36	so again now you have to go to the website we previously used to set up our	-
4:35:41	Google authentication	-
4:35:44	console.cloud.google.com then you'll have to go to your specific project in	-
4:35:49	this case share me and to credentials we can click web client 1 and finally we'll	-
4:35:56	have to add an authorized JavaScript origin in this case we can simply add	-
4:36:02	our newly created URL let's go ahead and add it and click save	-
4:36:07	there we go now we can go back to our website and open up the application tab	-
4:36:13	go to local storage and completely clear the local storage finally we can close	-
4:36:20	the console and reload the page it looks like we still have a quick	-
4:36:25	error in our pin.jsx component so let's go to	-
4:36:30	pin.jsx and the console says the error is in line 16. cannot read properties	-
4:36:37	now of Google ID so right here we're trying to get the Google ID through the	-
4:36:43	user but if the user is undefined or null in that case this is going to be an	-
4:36:50	error so we simply have to add a question mark right here for that Arrow	-
4:36:54	to be fixed now let's just simply search for Google ID across this file and see	-
4:37:00	if you're using it somewhere else as you can see we're using it here as	-
4:37:06	well so we're going to add two question marks and there is one final place where	-
4:37:11	we're using it and that is right here on line 98 in my case	-
4:37:16	now that we've made sure that the user actually exists let's also do a 100	-
4:37:22	check and re-navigate the user back to the login page if the user is not logged	-
4:37:28	in so to do that we can go to our pins container or the home page or maybe the	-
4:37:35	best way to do it is to go straight to the app.js and inside of here we're	-
4:37:40	gonna initialize the navigate Hook by saying navigate	-
4:37:45	is equal to use navigate and we call that as a hook then we're going to set	-
4:37:51	up a use effect right here that use effect is going to happen only	-
4:37:56	at the start right now and right here we'll try to get the user by same const	-
4:38:02	user is equal to fetch user remember this fetch user is coming from	-
4:38:09	dot slash utils forward slash fetch user we of course have to also import the use	-
4:38:15	effect at the top right here and finally we have to say if	-
4:38:21	there is no user in that case navigate to forward slash login	-
4:38:28	there we go now we are a hundred percent sure that if the user hasn't been logged	-
4:38:34	in or if for whatever reason the login expired we're going to re-navigate them	-
4:38:39	back to login with that said let's go ahead and open the view	-
4:38:44	terminal and then we can run npm run build one final time	-
4:38:50	while that build is happening we can go to our deployed page on netlify and you	-
4:38:56	can click deploys right here in your case there's going to be just one there	-
4:39:00	I was doing some testing and finally on your file explorer you can go to your	-
4:39:06	build folder click reveal in file explorer and	-
4:39:10	finally you can simply drag and drop your build folder right here we can	-
4:39:15	reload the page in a few seconds it's going to be published you can go back to	-
4:39:20	your page and reload it and as you can see on our new share me	-
4:39:26	jsm.netlify.app we've been redirected to login let's see if the sign in with	-
4:39:31	Google works a pop-up window appeared on my other screen I'm gonna log in using	-
4:39:36	my JavaScript Mastery account and in this case it looks like we got just one	-
4:39:41	small error if we go to console it's the same line it's going to be cannot read	-
4:39:48	property underscore ID add pin jsx 16. so that's really unfortunate we should	-
4:39:54	have paid attention to that right here there is our underscore ID and in this	-
4:39:59	case we also have to provide question marks right here	-
4:40:04	there we go so now I'm going to redeploy this npm run build and once it builds	-
4:40:11	out I'm going to go back to netlify deploys and I'm going to Simply drag and	-
4:40:17	drop the rebuild build folder there we go our application has been built and	-
4:40:22	I'm going to Simply reveal it in file explorer and I'm going to drag and drop	-
4:40:27	the build folder we're going to reload the page it is published go back on our	-
4:40:33	share me.netlify dot app and reload the page and there we go finally there were	-
4:40:40	some little hiccups at the end but everything turned out great we are on	-
4:40:45	our newly deployed application we have our profile page here the images work	-
4:40:50	fine this is the image Details page and we can go ahead and search for cats as	-
4:40:56	well there we go images of cats and let's go ahead and test the mobile view	-
4:41:01	as well so I'm going to right click inspect go to mobile view	-
4:41:07	and check this out it's looking great we built a real image sharing social media	-
4:41:16	application congratulations one last thing that I want to show you is that	-
4:41:22	you can open up your Visual Studio code and stop your other terminal from	-
4:41:27	running by pressing Ctrl C make sure that you're positioned in the backend	-
4:41:31	folder now and then run sanity deploy this is going to deploy your studio	-
4:41:38	online in here you have to choose your host	
4:41:41	name I'm going to use share me JSM this is going to build out your desk that	-
4:41:48	you'll be able to share with other people and everybody you give access to	-
4:41:52	will be able to manage the content of your database or of your backend through	-
4:41:57	sanity's desk system let's give it a minute and I'll show that to you in	-
4:42:02	action and there we go as I was speaking the deployed link is here you can	-
4:42:08	control click it and we are on our sanity's studio desk as you can see you	-
4:42:14	can give access to this link to other people and they will be able to create	-
4:42:18	new pins straight from this dashboard great of course you have to be cautious	-
4:42:24	when giving access to this or generally when storing user information through	-
4:42:29	any kind of content management system because right here you'll be able to see	-
4:42:34	the user information as well as the image and some other information like	-
4:42:39	IDs some of this information might have to be stored safely and securely and in	-
4:42:45	that regard you have to be careful of what content do you put on your content	-
4:42:49	Management systems but with that said this is great we can see all of our pens	-
4:42:54	here I'm incredibly happy with the site we ended up creating in this one video I	-
4:43:01	know it was a long one but hopefully you learned a lot along the way and I hope	-
4:43:06	you're gonna enjoy by putting this project on your portfolio	-
4:43:10	foreign [Music]	
4:43:16	before we dive into the development let me give you a really quick demo of the	-
4:43:22	entire application this is our store's homepage we have a	-
4:43:27	big banner indicating our featured product then we have a list of all of	-
4:43:33	our best selling product with a nice on Hover animation and finally we have a	-
4:43:40	beautiful sale Banner at the bottom right here and as I promised the best of	-
4:43:46	all is that everything you can see on this page can be dynamically modified	-
4:43:50	and that is only possible because of Sanity let me show you how it works live	-
4:43:55	we can modify the content for our Banner as well as all of our products for	-
4:44:01	example let's go into products and let's go into these headphones right here as	-
4:44:07	you can see we can add or change the images the product's name the unique	-
4:44:13	slug the price and the product details the same thing goes for changing every	-
4:44:20	single little detail in our Banner component as you can see right here in	-
4:44:26	this course you'll learn how to use sanity from scratch so that you can use	-
4:44:31	it in all of your future projects going back to our app clicking on a specific	-
4:44:37	product will open its product Details page here you can see the product title	-
4:44:42	as well as the number of reviews description and price you can also hover	-
4:44:49	over the thumbnails to see the images in more detail	-
4:44:53	there's also the animated you may also like section where you'll get the	-
4:44:59	recommended products for the item you're currently viewing	-
4:45:03	hovering over it will stop the animation and you can select another product you	-
4:45:08	can change the quantity and add the product to the cart so let's go ahead	-
4:45:13	and add a few products let's go for these headphones as well and let's click	-
4:45:18	buy Now by opening the cart you can modify the quantities of each individual	-
4:45:23	item as you can see right here and you can also remove them from the cart	-
4:45:28	finally when you're ready to purchase you can click the pay with stripe button	-
4:45:33	that'll lead you to a special stripe checkout where we have a nice overview	-
4:45:38	of our order here you can enter your payment details choose your shipping	-
4:45:43	method and finally complete the purchase and once you're done with the purchase	-
4:45:48	you'll be redirected to a special success page and of course the entire	-
4:45:55	website is completely mobile responsive so as you can see as we scroll you'll	-
4:46:01	notice that it feels like a native mobile application everything is fully	-
4:46:07	mobile responsive so that's it how do you like it it's a phenomenal	-
4:46:12	full-fledged e-commerce application I hope you're hyped so without any further	-
4:46:18	Ado let's get straight into it to start off with creating our amazing e-commerce	-
4:46:24	application we're going to start from scratch we are on our desktop have an	-
4:46:29	empty Visual Studio code window open and we're going to right click and create a	-
4:46:35	new folder called e-commerce there we go the only thing you have to do is simply	-
4:46:41	drag and drop it into your empty Visual Studio code window of course feel free	-
4:46:45	to use your own code editor of choice in this case we're using visual studio code	-
4:46:50	as it is the most popular code editor out there it also has a great integrated	-
4:46:56	terminal so you can go to view and then terminal	
4:46:59	we can clear it and in here we can run all of the necessary commands to	-
4:47:04	initialize our application in this video we'll be using next.js it's going to	-
4:47:10	make our react application even quicker and the website with all the products is	-
4:47:16	going to load incredibly quickly next.js allows us to statically render all of	-
4:47:22	our websites making them incredibly efficient so all that we have to do to	-
4:47:27	initialize a nexjs application is to run the command MPX create Dash next Dash	-
4:47:34	app and that's it run it it's going to ask you to install the create next app	-
4:47:40	package so just press y there and press enter you'll have to enter the name of	-
4:47:46	your project in this case I'm going to type e-commerce	-
4:47:51	and the process of installation is going to begin and we should be able to see	-
4:47:56	all of our code in just a minute I'm gonna pause this video and I'll be right	-
4:48:01	back as soon as it is done as soon as our app is initialized we can open up	-
4:48:06	our Explorer and see that we have a new folder right here with some more files	-
4:48:11	and folders this is a Nexia structure the most important thing here is the	-
4:48:16	pages folder where we'll be creating our components and Pages as we go along	-
4:48:22	we're going to add a few more folders to keep a nice and a consistent folder and	-
4:48:27	file structure before we spin up our application let's first install all of	-
4:48:32	the necessary dependencies and packages that we're going to use in our project	-
4:48:36	right now we only have next react and react Dom down in the description	-
4:48:42	there's going to be a GitHub gist file containing all of the code that I'm	-
4:48:47	gonna reference in this video the first thing in there are going to be all of	-
4:48:51	the necessary dependencies so just hover over these lines and override them with	-
4:48:56	all the dependencies that we have to install the dependencies include sanity	-
4:49:01	and Sanity image URL of course we're going to use this to dynamically change	-
4:49:05	all the content of our banners and our products we're gonna also use stripe	-
4:49:10	which is one of the most popular payment gateways allowing us to process real	-
4:49:15	transactions right inside of our application we're going to also use a	-
4:49:19	confetti package that's going to show that nice confetti once the order is	-
4:49:23	fulfilled we're going to use the next sanity image to process images and	-
4:49:29	stripe itself we're going to also use react hot toast to provide that nice	-
4:49:33	Banner as soon as something happens like a notification and finally react icons	-
4:49:39	for all of the great icons the only thing we have to do is first CD into the	-
4:49:45	folder that next.js created for us in my case that's going to be e-commerce you	-
4:49:50	can check that right here that we are inside of a new folder created for us by	-
4:49:55	next.js so now we moved into it and then you can run npm install dash dash Legacy	-
4:50:03	Dash peer Dash depths this is going to make sure to install exactly the same	-
4:50:09	versions of packages so that whenever you're watching this video be it after a	-
4:50:13	year or two years you'll always be able to replicate exactly what I have in this	-
4:50:19	video run this command let's wait about a minute and I'll be right back and	-
4:50:25	there we go once all of your dependence is installed we can finally spin up our	-
4:50:29	application on localhost 3000 by running the npm Run Dev command	-
4:50:35	immediately you can control click or command click the localhost 3000 and	-
4:50:41	it's going to open up the demo page right on your local host that means that	-
4:50:46	we are ready to configure sanity which is going to allow us to so much more	-
4:50:51	easily manage the data for our entire Ecommerce store throughout our entire	-
4:50:57	application development so let's go ahead and set it up right	-
4:51:02	away to start off you can click the link in	
4:51:05	the description sanity team was kind enough to provide you with double the	-
4:51:10	free monthly usage and that includes 200 000 API requests 1 million API CDN	-
4:51:18	requests and 20 Gigabytes of bandwidth that's going to be more than enough for	-
4:51:24	99.9 of people myself included and that's great because it means that we'll	-
4:51:30	be able to build our e-commerce application from scratch to finish and	-
4:51:35	deployment completely for free using the newest and most modern Technologies	-
4:51:42	sanity is of course going to be of great help here because they're a platform for	-
4:51:46	structured data that lets us build better digital experiences essentially	-
4:51:51	all of the data for our products and Banners on our store are going to be	-
4:51:55	managed by sanity you'll soon see the amazing benefits that sanity offers so	-
4:52:01	to get started let's simply copy this to our clipboard let's open up our terminal	-
4:52:06	by pressing Ctrl and then backtick or going to view and then terminal	-
4:52:11	let's stop it from running by pressing Ctrl C and then Y and we can clear the	-
4:52:17	console finally we can paste what we copied this	
4:52:21	is first going to install sanity CLI globally and then you need to press	-
4:52:25	enter one more time to initialize sanity and to apply a JavaScript Mastery coupon	-
4:52:30	now there might have been some additional prompts that I didn't see	-
4:52:34	right now because I have already used sanity before if you haven't you'll most	-
4:52:39	likely just have to say yes to install sanity and that's about it	-
4:52:43	as soon as you're done with that we'll have to log into our sanity account and	-
4:52:47	for that I'm gonna use Google so simply press enter and there we go login	-
4:52:52	successful back in our terminal we can immediately enter our project name I'm	-
4:52:58	going to say e-commerce we're also asked if we want to use the	-
4:53:04	default data set configuration and to that I'm going to Simply say yes or why	-
4:53:09	the data set is being created as we speak we're fine with the project output	-
4:53:14	path so I'm simply gonna press enter and we can choose a template for our	-
4:53:20	project there's a movie Project an e-commerce project a Blog and a clean	-
4:53:26	project with no schemas we are building an e-commerce site so an e-commerce	-
4:53:31	template would make a lot of sense but as you already know here in JavaScript	-
4:53:35	Mastery I always take you one step at a time and one step further so we're going	-
4:53:41	to start with a clean project with no predefined schemas so that I can teach	-
4:53:45	you exactly how you can use sanity and how you can use it on all of your future	-
4:53:50	projects there we go creating default project	
4:53:54	files and resolving dependencies and there we go the setup has been	-
4:54:00	successful before we can check out all the great things that we can explore	-
4:54:03	with sanity we can notice that git is tracking all of our active changes and	-
4:54:08	there's more than ten thousand so what you can do is go to dot get ignore and	-
4:54:14	then instead of just forward slash node modules we want to Simply say node	-
4:54:19	modules without the forward slash that's going to make sure to include the node	-
4:54:23	modules inside of the eCommerce sanity project as well	-
4:54:28	with that simple change you can go to your git and then click right here to	-
4:54:34	reload it and you should be able to see only 21 changes great with that said we	-
4:54:41	can now explore our terminal and see that there are many commands that we can	-
4:54:45	test out to explore what sanity has to offer we can start with the First	-
4:54:50	Command which is sanity docs this is going to open up the documentation right	-
4:54:56	inside of your browser and you can use the search to really learn about	-
4:54:59	anything you need now we can explore the sanity manage command this is going to	-
4:55:06	open up your sanity manager and from there you'll be able to choose your	-
4:55:11	current project we'll have to get back to this page later on to give us all the	-
4:55:15	permissions we need to properly set up our application and to finally get	-
4:55:20	access to our content we can CD into e-commerce this time we are into sanity	-
4:55:27	e-commerce I know this is getting quite repetitive I didn't really anticipate to	-
4:55:31	have this many e-commerce projects but the original e-commerce one is our next	-
4:55:36	GS application and then the inner one is going to be our sanity studio so it	-
4:55:42	might be a good idea to rename it so I'm going to Simply rename and that's going	-
4:55:46	to be sanity underscore e-commerce so now we can CD and then we can CD into	-
4:55:52	sanity e-commerce inside of there you can run the sanity start command	-
4:55:58	and this is going to spin up the content Studio on localhost	-
4:56:04	333 if we go there you'll have to log in and as soon as you do you'll be able to	-
4:56:10	see that now we have an empty schema right here not much to see right but as	-
4:56:16	soon as we adding our schemas inside of our code this sanity desk is going to	-
4:56:22	start looking much more appealing and feature full and that brings us to the	-
4:56:27	next task and that is actually accessing the files and folders that were created	-
4:56:32	for us automatically most importantly the schemas folder right here for now we	-
4:56:38	just have one schema as you can see right here but soon enough we're gonna	-
4:56:42	add the schema for our projects as well so I'm going to teach you how to do that	-
4:56:48	from scratch right away so to create your own custom schema you can right	-
4:56:53	click the schemas folder and create a new file let's call it	-
4:56:57	product.js yes inside of the product the only thing you	-
4:57:02	have to do is say export default and then export an object this is all that	-
4:57:09	it is you don't have to use any special syntax you simply export your schema as	-
4:57:14	a basic JavaScript object a sanity schema needs to have a name and in this	-
4:57:20	case that's going to be product the title is going to be product with a	-
4:57:25	capital p and then we also need a type and a type	-
4:57:30	of this is going to be document finally the most important thing is to provide	-
4:57:36	the fields for our schema the fields are going to be object-based so we can	-
4:57:41	create inner objects inside of the fields array and the first field is	-
4:57:46	going to be our image so we can say name is equal to image	-
4:57:51	the title is going to be an image with a capital I and then we also need a type	-
4:57:56	and this is going to be array so we can have an array of images and check this	-
4:58:03	out see how I said that an array of images so what sanity did is created an	-
4:58:09	off property and we can say array of type is equal to image almost like	-
4:58:16	talking in plain English an array of images and we're going to also provide	-
4:58:21	an additional options object right here where we can say hotspot	-
4:58:26	is equal to true and if you don't know what that means what you can do is go to	-
4:58:32	sanity docs and search for hot spot there we go you can immediately see that	-
4:58:38	this is a property on the image tab let's search for Hotspot and let's see	-
4:58:43	what does it mean enables the user interface for selecting what areas of an	-
4:58:48	image should be cropped what areas should never be cropped and the center	-
4:58:53	of the area to crop when resizing essentially just helps us to better	-
4:58:57	position the image we upload and you can see that it is a Boolean so whatever you	-
4:59:02	want to do it is incredibly easy to search the docs for it and then	-
4:59:06	implement it on your own now we can go to the next field which is going to be	-
4:59:10	below this object this one is going to be a bit simpler name is going to be	-
4:59:16	name the product name the title is also going to be name	-
4:59:21	with a capital N and finally the type is going to be string nothing extra we have	-
4:59:27	to pass right here next we're going to have a slug a slug is like a URL like a	-
4:59:34	unique string so the name is actually going to be slug	-
4:59:38	then the title is going to be slug as well with the capital S and type is	-
4:59:45	going to be slug so as you can see sanity has built a custom type for	-
4:59:50	Unique identifiers we can also provide the options	-
4:59:55	and we can set the source of our slug which is going to be name so it's going	-
5:00:01	to automatically generate a unique slug based on our name property we can also	-
5:00:07	provide a max length property which is going to be set to 90 characters that	-
5:00:12	should be more than enough finally every single product of course needs to have	-
5:00:18	a price so we can say name of a new field is price and also title is going	-
5:00:24	to be price as well the type is going to be number and the last thing we can add	-
5:00:31	is going to be another field where the name is going to be set to details	-
5:00:37	and finally title is going to be set to details as well and the type of details	-
5:00:44	is going to be string as straightforward as that we've just created our product	-
5:00:51	schema there is going to be just one more additional schema for this entire	-
5:00:57	e-commerce application and that is going to be our	-
5:01:01	banner.js file since we've just explored the way to do schemas and the ways in	-
5:01:07	which you can create Fields arrays of fields options and more to save your	-
5:01:13	time down in the description in that GitHub gist file there's going to be the	-
5:01:18	banner.js file right here you can find the schema for our Banner as you can see	-
5:01:24	there isn't any logic happening here we're just again setting some of these	-
5:01:28	similar fields that we had before just some strings names products descriptions	-
5:01:34	and so on everything is right here so again I just wanted to save your time go	-
5:01:40	down in the description copy it paste it here and we should be good to go we are	-
5:01:46	therefore ready to use those schemas inside of our schema.js file first of	-
5:01:53	all let's remove all these comments just to have the easier view right here	-
5:01:58	because I'm guiding you and then we can import our documents we can do that by	-
5:02:04	saying import product from dot slash product	-
5:02:10	and we can repeat that one more time by saying import that's going to be Banner	-
5:02:17	from dot slash Banner the last and only thing we have	-
5:02:23	to do is we have to add our documents right here that's going to be product	-
5:02:27	and banner inside of this array that is it now let's go back to our sanity desk	-
5:02:36	that's going to be on our localhost 3333 and as you can see now we have our	-
5:02:44	product and we have our Banner let's go ahead and add one demo product	-
5:02:50	so we can create a new product right here we immediately have a nice looking	-
5:02:56	interface where we can enter the product image I've uploaded this great looking	-
5:03:01	image of headphones and if you want to use the same images that I'm using	-
5:03:06	throughout this entire project the link to the assets is also going to be	-
5:03:10	somewhere down below either in the gist file as a zipped folder or somewhere	-
5:03:15	else but you'll definitely be able to find it if you want to replicate exactly	-
5:03:20	what I'm doing in this video so let's close this and let's choose a name I'm	-
5:03:25	going to go with headphones right here and now a cool part here is that the	-
5:03:30	slag can be immediately generated headphones without any extra numbers or	-
5:03:35	letters because this is the first instance of the headphones but if we	-
5:03:39	were to create another one then a unique slag would be automatically generated	-
5:03:44	for us let's go with something like 99 for the price and the details can be	-
5:03:50	great looking and sounding headphones and we can click publish there we go a	-
5:03:58	new document was just published and we can see it right here under product	-
5:04:02	category and under products amazing what we've done just now is basically	-
5:04:09	implemented an entire database think about that we've created a schema and	-
5:04:16	added the ability for users to add new content to that database how crazy is	-
5:04:21	that imagine if we're working on a meron application mongodb Express react and	-
5:04:27	node imagine how much time we would have to spend just to come to this point	-
5:04:32	where we're at right now it would take hours to set everything up but we've	-
5:04:37	done it in just a couple of minutes and now that sanity is fully configured and	-
5:04:42	set up our backend is fully done now we can start creating our front-end	-
5:04:48	application and then later on we're going to connect the two phenomenal 4r	-
5:04:54	front-end we are of course going to use reaction yes well technically nextgs	-
5:04:59	which is a framework for react it's going to give us access to that	-
5:05:04	beautiful development workflow that react offers but what even faster and	-
5:05:09	more optimized page loads so with that said I hope you're excited so let's get	-
5:05:15	started we can start inside of our pages and inside of our index.js page this is	-
5:05:22	our main page so what we can do is delete everything that we have in here	-
5:05:28	so far let's just make it a clean slate and you know what we can actually remove	-
5:05:34	everything we have in here we can use that shortcut	-
5:05:38	r-a-f-c-e react Arrow function export component and simply press enter	-
5:05:44	if this didn't work for you that must mean that you don't have the necessary	-
5:05:49	extension installed that is es7 snippet so if you search for that you should be	-
5:05:55	able to find es7 plus react Redux react native Snippets simply install that go	-
5:06:02	back Type rafc e and you should be able to see this code output if it didn't	-
5:06:10	work simply type it out by hand but in any case we are ready to start creating	-
5:06:15	our index page a of course to be able to see what we're coding in real time we	-
5:06:20	can open up our terminal press Ctrl C and then simply CD out of Sanity	-
5:06:26	e-commerce and then run npm run Dev to run our application on localhost 3000	-
5:06:32	there you should only be able to see small Index right here now I'm going to	-
5:06:38	pull the browser and visual studio code side by side so we can see everything at	-
5:06:43	once and there we go we are ready to proceed now you might notice that we	-
5:06:50	have this red squiggly line right here cannot find module next Babble to easily	-
5:06:56	fix that we can just go inside of the root of our folder e-commerce and we can	-
5:07:02	create a new file called dot Babble RC inside of there we can create an object	-
5:07:09	because this is a Json file and then we can write presets	-
5:07:14	is going to be an array of one string that's going to say next Babble like	-
5:07:20	this and then we also have to go inside of	
5:07:24	the DOT eslintrc.json we're going to switch this extents from	-
5:07:29	a string to an array and then as the first property in that array we're going	-
5:07:35	to say next for slash Babble and then add a comma like this now we made a	-
5:07:42	change here and also a change here make sure that you have the babble	-
5:07:47	inside of the root of this folder not outside of it and then if we go back to	-
5:07:52	our index.js now you can see that problem is entirely fixed and we are	-
5:07:58	ready to proceed with the development we can start by renaming this to home	-
5:08:04	that's going to be a better fitting name there we go and finally we can start	-
5:08:09	with the jsx so we're going to have one div or rather one empty react fragment	-
5:08:15	wrapping everything inside of there we're going to have a	-
5:08:20	hero Banner component for now let's simply leave it as a text hero Banner	-
5:08:26	below that we're going to have a div and this div is going to have an H2	-
5:08:33	that's going to say best selling products like this	-
5:08:39	we can also add a P tag below that's going to say	-
5:08:43	speakers of many variations of course feel free to type whatever you	-
5:08:49	prefer here this is going to be that nice looking Banner as soon as we	-
5:08:53	implement the Styles finally in here we're going to also Loop over our	-
5:08:58	products so we can create a div right here and we cannot yet Loop over a real	-
5:09:03	products because we haven't fetched them from sanity but let's create an array of	-
5:09:08	for example a string of product one let's also do product two and let's	-
5:09:15	simply call a DOT map of course this has to be in curly braces	-
5:09:21	how could have I forgotten that and then we get an arrow function we get a	-
5:09:27	product for each one of the elements we're mapping over and then finally we	-
5:09:32	can simply return the product component for now that is simply going to be the	-
5:09:37	actual product name itself so you can see product one product two later on	-
5:09:42	these are going to be real products and finally we're gonna also need a footer	-
5:09:48	at the bottom this is going to be another custom special component which	-
5:09:53	we're going to implement really soon and that's our index page Believe It or Not	-
5:09:58	of course to keep our code clean and separate more code is going to go into	-
5:10:02	these separate components in just a moment but before we Implement those	-
5:10:07	components let's actually get our Styles so inside of the styles.js you'll be	-
5:10:13	able to find two different files globals.css and home Module home module	-
5:10:19	was for that default Styles we had so you can simply delete it and then you	-
5:10:23	can go into globals.css and also navigate to the description down below	-
5:10:29	to that same GitHub gist and from there you'll be able to copy the entire style	-
5:10:34	sheet for this project simply copy and paste it right here	-
5:10:40	this is going to save you so much time When developing this project this isn't	-
5:10:45	a beginner project it is already at an intermediate or an advanced level	-
5:10:50	because it is a real eCommerce application with a Content management	-
5:10:54	system and also complete payments integration for that reason I want you	-
5:11:00	to focus on things that matter writing real logic and actually creating your	-
5:11:06	own e-commerce application from scratch I didn't want you to spend time writing	-
5:11:10	CSS so I provided it all for you once again the link is down in the	-
5:11:16	description in a GitHub gist now that we've done that we can close it and we	-
5:11:21	can go to our underscore app.js we can just check that our import is right here	-
5:11:27	which means that our styles are now being used and we can actually check	-
5:11:31	that out if we apply some class names right here let's add a class name to our	-
5:11:37	div something like class name is equal to	
5:11:42	products Dash heading and save it as you can see this is immediately looking so	-
5:11:49	much better we can also give a class name to our	-
5:11:53	products container class name is going to be products Dash	-
5:11:57	container and that's just centered it in the	
5:12:01	middle we're going to use all of these class	
5:12:03	names that are inside of that Global CSS once again to speed up our workflow	-
5:12:09	and finally we are ready to set up our basic file and folder structure and set	-
5:12:15	up all of our components that we'll be using throughout this entire project	-
5:12:20	spending a few minutes on that right away is going to save us a lot of time	-
5:12:25	in the future because we're already gonna have all of the components right	-
5:12:30	here so let's do that right away we can start by creating a new components	-
5:12:36	folder inside of the main e-commerce one of	
5:12:40	course inside of there we can create all of the components that we're going to	-
5:12:44	use throughout this entire course so let's create the first one we can create	-
5:12:50	that hero Banner component Dot jsx inside of there you can run rafce and	-
5:12:59	that is going to be enough to start with we can repeat this process for all of	-
5:13:03	the other components that we're going to use so let's go ahead the next one is	-
5:13:07	going to be cart.jsx again run rafce and we've got	-
5:13:13	it then we're gonna also have the footer.jsx Run rafce for the footer as	-
5:13:20	well we're going to also have a footer	
5:13:25	banner.jsx component we can also run rafc there	-
5:13:30	we're gonna also have the hero Banner component so hero banner.jsx we're going	-
5:13:36	to also have a really important layout.jsx component we can run rafce in	-
5:13:43	there for now and finally we're going to have a	-
5:13:47	navbar.jsx again with rafc E and finally the last one is going to be	-
5:13:54	product.jsx component once again rafce now that we have all of these components	-
5:14:01	we can start importing them inside of our pages to do that though we can	-
5:14:06	create one final file inside of the components folder called index.js	-
5:14:12	from this single file we're going to export all of the other components so we	-
5:14:17	can say export in curly braces default as then the name of the component such	-
5:14:23	as footer and then from dot slash footer now we can repeat this for every single	-
5:14:30	component we have the next one is going to be layout then we're going to have	-
5:14:36	our nav bar we also are going to have our product	-
5:14:40	we're gonna also have our hero Banner right here	-
5:14:44	key row Banner finally we need our footer banner and	-
5:14:51	finally we need the cart there we go that's going to be coming	-
5:14:55	from cart so now we're exporting all of these components and we can go back to	-
5:15:01	our index.js so I can show you how we'll be importing them into all of our Pages	-
5:15:06	now that we created that special index file we can import them in one line by	-
5:15:12	saying import we can specify all of the components	-
5:15:15	here in this case we're going to use product	
5:15:19	footer banner and finally hero banner and that's gonna be coming from da dot	-
5:15:26	slash components there we go and we immediately get one error saying that we	-
5:15:32	cannot immediately use the dot jsx file extension but we can add a babble preset	-
5:15:38	react to the preset section of your Babel config so let's go to our Babel RC	-
5:15:44	and under preset we can say comma and simply add Babel preset react now since	-
5:15:52	we've added this we also have to install it so let's open up our terminal	-
5:15:56	stop it from running and then run npm install dash dash save Dash Dev and then	-
5:16:04	add Babel forward slash preset Dash react this should get installed pretty	-
5:16:09	soon and we can go under package.json and under Dev dependencies to check that	-
5:16:16	it is properly installed now let's run npm run Dev	-
5:16:22	now if we reload our page you can see that the error is still not quite fixed	-
5:16:29	although this seemed like a trivial thing like we just want to be able to	-
5:16:33	use the dot jsx extension We've ran into quite a few problems here but as you	-
5:16:39	already know here in JavaScript Mastery I don't skip over any bugs I'm going to	-
5:16:44	go through this with you no matter how trivial it is and it looks like I've	-
5:16:49	made just one tiny mistake it looks like this here was supposed to be presets and	-
5:16:55	right here we don't need the initial preset if we're gonna use the Babel	-
5:16:59	preset react so now if we close this and the re-run R terminal by pressing Ctrl C	-
5:17:06	and then Y and then npm run Dev again we should be able to go back reload the	-
5:17:12	page and see another error this means that we are good to go we can go to our	-
5:17:18	pages and then underscore app.js since we're using a pre reset react now we'll	-
5:17:24	have to import react from react so we can use the jsx syntax	-
5:17:31	there we go and we are back where we started if you remember correctly we	-
5:17:38	were in our index.js file we just imported our components and we were	-
5:17:43	getting ready to use them instead of this hero Banner text we're going to use	-
5:17:48	a hero Banner self-closing component and then under footer we're gonna use that	-
5:17:53	as a footer Banner and then also a self-closing component	-
5:17:59	so so far nothing has changed but now we can actually go into our hero banner and	-
5:18:06	start implementing it right away to start implementing our hero Banner we	-
5:18:12	can start with the outer div this div is going to have a class name equal to Hero	-
5:18:20	Dash Banner Dash container inside of there we're going to have one more div	-
5:18:25	that isn't going to have any classes and inside of there we're gonna start with	-
5:18:30	some text so first we can have a P tag it's going to have a class name equal to	-
5:18:37	Beats solo this is going to be for our headphones and right here we're gonna	-
5:18:43	pass Dynamic data but we haven't yet fetched anything from sanity so what we	-
5:18:49	can do is say small text right here with capital letters this is going to be	-
5:18:55	dynamic soon enough then we're going to have an H3 just below this H3 is going	-
5:19:03	to render the mid text there we go and finally we can have an	-
5:19:08	image right here and we don't yet have the source so I	-
5:19:13	think we can leave the source as an empty string and we're going to also	-
5:19:16	provide the alt tag equal to headphones and we can also give it a class name	-
5:19:23	equal to Hero Dash Banner Dash image once again you cannot see it yet because	-
5:19:30	we're not fetching real data but we will soon	
5:19:35	below that image we're gonna have a div and inside of this div we're going to	-
5:19:40	have a link property a link is like an href but in next.js so right here we can	-
5:19:47	import link from next forward slash link we can use	-
5:19:53	it right here and a link accepts an href property just like an H1 tag does and	-
5:20:01	for now let's point it to forward slash product	
5:20:04	and then forward slash ID this ID will of course be dynamic soon enough	-
5:20:11	we're going to wrap our button with this link so right inside of there we're	-
5:20:15	gonna have a button component that button is going to have a type	-
5:20:20	equal to button and inside of there we can render the button text which is also	-
5:20:27	going to be dynamic finally below our link we're gonna have a div	-
5:20:32	and that div is going to have a class name equal to	-
5:20:37	d-e-s-c as in description so there we can simply render an H5 element that is	-
5:20:44	going to Simply say description and below that in a P tag we can render the	-
5:20:49	actual description now of course all of the data that is	-
5:20:54	currently in capitalized letters will be imported straight from sanity so we'll	-
5:20:59	be able to modify this on the go through the sanity platform and now that we've	-
5:21:04	created this Banner it might actually be a good idea to connect to sanity right	-
5:21:10	away that way later on we'll be able to pull all the products extremely easily	-
5:21:17	so the question is what do we have to do to connect our application to sanity	-
5:21:24	well first of all we're going to create one additional folder right here called	-
5:21:29	lib as in library inside of there we're going to add a new	-
5:21:34	file called client.js this is going to be for our	-
5:21:40	sanity client so inside of there we can say import	-
5:21:44	sanity client from add sanity forward slash client and we're going to also	-
5:21:52	import image URL Builder from at sanity forward slash image Dash	-
5:22:00	URL the only thing we have to do is create something known as a sanity	-
5:22:05	client so cons client and that is equal to sanity client which we call as a	-
5:22:11	function and provide only one parameter which is an object inside of there we	-
5:22:17	have to provide a few properties a project ID so that sanity knows which	-
5:22:22	project to connect us with a data set so that we know are we in development or	-
5:22:28	production we also need to pass the API version	
5:22:33	finally we need to pass the use CDN which can be set to true or false in	-
5:22:38	this case that's going to be set to true and we need to pass our token all of	-
5:22:44	these are values that you might think we don't already have the access to but we	-
5:22:49	do we just have to go back to our sanity manager	
5:22:53	to do that I'm going to open up a new terminal window I'm going to CD into	-
5:22:58	e-commerce and then CD into sanity e-commerce there we can run sanity	-
5:23:04	manage and as you can see that opened up our project we can first of all copy the	-
5:23:11	project ID and paste it right here then we can go to data sets and see that we	-
5:23:17	have one production data set so we can simply say production right here our API	-
5:23:23	version is going to be	-
5:23:28	2022-03-10 this was a time when I was developing this project	-
5:23:33	and finally we have to get our token to get to the Token we can expand this go	-
5:23:39	to API tokens and then we can create a new API token let's name it development	-
5:23:47	and we're going to give it read and write access finally let's click save	-
5:23:52	let's copy this token right here and what we have to do is not paste it	-
5:23:58	right here due to security reasons so rather what we're going to do is we're	-
5:24:03	going to create a new DOT EnV file so right inside of our e-commerce we can	-
5:24:09	create a new DOT EnV file and there we can say something like next underscore	-
5:24:16	public underscore sanity underscore token and we can simply paste the token	-
5:24:22	right here now what we can say right here is	-
5:24:27	process.env dot next underscore public underscore sanity underscore token and	-
5:24:35	we should be good to go when it comes to actually connecting to sanity instead of	-
5:24:40	setting this client to a variable we're going to immediately export it so that	-
5:24:44	we can use it elsewhere so export const sanity client instead of setting this	-
5:24:49	sanity client to a variable we're going to immediately export it by saying	-
5:24:54	export const client is equal to sanity client finally we have to be able to use	-
5:25:01	the sanity images so we can say Builder cons Builder is equal to image URL	-
5:25:08	Builder and we need to pass in the client we've	
5:25:12	just created finally sanity is going to give us access to the URLs where our	-
5:25:17	images are stored so we have to export const URL for is equal to callback	-
5:25:25	function or we get the source and then we can simply say Builder dot image and	-
5:25:30	we get that Source this is something that we're doing just once per project	-
5:25:35	and once we do it we can simply use sanity client at all the times and	-
5:25:41	anywhere in the code so now we can go back to our index.js and right here we	-
5:25:47	can say Import in curly braces client from dot slash lib	-
5:25:54	forward slash client there we go	-
5:25:59	now the situation with react.js and nextgs is just a bit different in react	-
5:26:06	we would immediately just create a use effect right here which is a lifecycle	-
5:26:11	method and then just call the client right there and fetch the data in	-
5:26:16	next.js that is just a bit different in xjs to fetch data we use something known	-
5:26:23	as get server side props if you export a function called get server side props	-
5:26:29	for server-side rendering for my page next.js will pre-render this page on	-
5:26:35	each request using the data returned by get server-side props essentially	-
5:26:40	whenever you're fetching data from an API or from a CMS we can use the get	-
5:26:45	server side prop function so just at the bottom right here	-
5:26:50	we can export const get server side prompts and that is an asynchronous	-
5:26:59	function so we can say async and then open a function block	-
5:27:04	right here we first have to form a sanity query so we can say const query	-
5:27:10	is equal to a string asterisk meaning to fetch all	-
5:27:16	a pair of square brackets underscore type is double equal to and then in	-
5:27:23	double quota strings product so we're essentially saying here let's grab all	-
5:27:28	of the products from our sanity dashboard now that we have that query we	-
5:27:33	can simply say const products is equal to a weight we use that sanity client	-
5:27:39	dot Fetch and then we can pass in the query now we're going to repeat this	-
5:27:44	process to also fetch the data for the banner so we can say Banner query right	-
5:27:49	here and instead of fetching the product we're simply going to fetch everything	-
5:27:53	where type is equal to Banner and we have to pass the banner query right here	-
5:28:00	and change this to Banner data finally remember what we said whatever	-
5:28:06	get server side props returns that gets populated into our function so what we	-
5:28:13	can do is say return an object that includes the props object where we're	-
5:28:19	going to pass in the products and banner data that is all that we have to do in	-
5:28:27	next.js now what happens is inside of our props right here we get the data	-
5:28:33	which we passed right here at the bottom meaning products and also Banner data if	-
5:28:40	you remember correctly I think we already had one product created right so	-
5:28:45	what we can do is we can Loop over the products right here	-
5:28:51	let's add a question mark dot to make sure that we have some and then we want	-
5:28:55	to return product dot name I think that's going to make sense	-
5:29:01	now if we reload the page we cannot see any changes yet but what we can do is	-
5:29:07	pass the hero Banner prop to our hero Banner component we could simply pass	-
5:29:14	the banner data and then the first element but	-
5:29:19	first we have to ask ourselves what exactly Banner data is and in which	-
5:29:24	format is sanity returning the data to us so I'm going to add a block of code	-
5:29:30	here and say console log that's going to be Banner data like this let's see what	-
5:29:38	is it made of we can go to the console and you can see	-
5:29:41	that it is an array with zero elements so we have to go to our sanity desk and	-
5:29:48	actually add it there to do that we can go to our terminal and run sanity start	-
5:29:54	which is going to open up the sanity desk on localhost	-
5:29:59	3333 and there we go once it is open we can go to Banner and create a new	-
5:30:06	element let's upload the image as well I've chose the same old headphones image	-
5:30:13	for our button text let's do something like shop now	-
5:30:18	for our product we can simply say headphones	
5:30:21	description can be something like best headphones	
5:30:27	on the market we can also go with small text something	-
5:30:31	like let's do Beats Solo air something like that	-
5:30:36	mid text can be something like summer sale people love sales right and then	-
5:30:42	for large text we can have some random words like fine and smile discount can	-
5:30:50	be something like 20 off and then sale time can be let's do 15	-
5:30:57	November to 7th December there we go and let's click publish	-
5:31:05	now as soon as we do that we can go back to our localhost 3000 and we immediately	-
5:31:11	get an array that now has one object with all the data we just passed in	-
5:31:17	so we now know that we have Banner data so now we can pass hero Banner is equal	-
5:31:25	to if Banner data dot length exists then we want to pass so end end Banner data	-
5:31:34	zero because we're going to always pass in that first object right here inside	-
5:31:39	of this array now going back to our hero Banner we are	-
5:31:44	accepting a hero Banner prop right here and we can actually use it to display	-
5:31:51	Dynamic data so right inside the small text we can say hero Banner dot small	-
5:31:59	text and if we save that immediately we get Beats Solo air	-
5:32:05	for Mid text we can do the same thing essentially copy this	-
5:32:09	paste it here and render the mid text right here summer sale	-
5:32:15	below that we also can have one another H1	
5:32:21	and inside of this H1 we're going to render the large text one	-
5:32:28	fine summer sale looking fine and then finally we have to render our image now	-
5:32:34	what we can do is we can import that URL for property so import	-
5:32:41	url4 and that's coming from dot slash lib forward slash client	-
5:32:49	now we can finally say url4 and then hero Banner	-
5:32:55	dot image so the URL for that is contained right here and now we have our	-
5:33:01	great looking headphones under link we can now navigate to a real URL so right	-
5:33:07	here we can put backticks and then inside of there if we wrap this with	-
5:33:13	curly braces inside of there we can say product	-
5:33:16	forward slash dollar sign curly braces hero Banner dot	-
5:33:22	product there we go so now we're going to	
5:33:25	actually navigate to that product and also inside of the button we can render	-
5:33:30	the hero Banner Dot and that's going to be button text	-
5:33:35	shop now finally under description we can render hero Banner dot desc best	-
5:33:42	headphones on the market so now we immediately have this Banner	-
5:33:47	but the best thing about this is that we can change it whenever we want whenever	-
5:33:52	there's a new sale we can just go to our sanity studio and simply change the	-
5:33:57	values right here or change the product all of that is immediately going to work	-
5:34:02	but of course we're just getting to the real deal and that is fetching all of	-
5:34:06	the products that we create inside of our sanity studio right here well we're	-
5:34:11	already doing that if you think about it we can see headphones right here and if	-
5:34:16	we go to our content the only product we have are one pair of headphones amazing	-
5:34:23	so far we've done most of the work we connected with our sanity we created the	-
5:34:30	entire backend database all the schemas and structures and we are simply ready	-
5:34:36	to move forward with our index.js the next part of course is the most	-
5:34:42	important part and that is the part where we create the product component to	-
5:34:47	which we pass all of the product data so that is coming right up let's go ahead	-
5:34:52	and make our e-commerce webshop to start with our products we of course have to	-
5:34:59	call our product component so right here insta of just displaying the product	-
5:35:04	name we can go and render or call out our self-closing product component to	-
5:35:10	that component we're going to provide a key which is going to be product dot	-
5:35:15	underscore ID and we're going to also provide the entire product object as	-
5:35:21	product there we go so now as you can see if we reload the page we are seeing	-
5:35:27	just the keyword product here because if we control click into product that is	-
5:35:32	the only thing we are rendering but now alongside that we're getting the entire	-
5:35:37	object containing the data about our existing products so what we can do is	-
5:35:43	also import a link right here from next forward slash link we're going to use	-
5:35:50	that to link to the product Details page of course	-
5:35:53	and then we also need to import that URL for coming from	-
5:36:00	lib forward slash client we're going to use this to get the URL for the image	-
5:36:06	inside of our sanity dashboard so right off the bat we can immediately	-
5:36:11	destructure some of the things from inside of our product that's going to be	-
5:36:15	the image name Slug and finally the price we just put it in another pair of	-
5:36:22	curly braces and with that we are ready to return some jsx of course that jsx is	-
5:36:29	not just going to say product we're going to have one div and inside of that	-
5:36:34	div we're going to render a link component	
5:36:37	that link is going to have an href property which is going to point to a	-
5:36:42	dynamic URL of forward slash product and then forward slash slug dot current so	-
5:36:49	it's going to point the slug of that specific product we said that slug is an	-
5:36:55	element that is unique essentially a name but if we have multiple products of	-
5:36:59	the same name then that slag is going to have some extra characters added to it	-
5:37:04	of course we have to add a child element for this link to work so as soon as we	-
5:37:09	add that it's going to be fixed right away	
5:37:12	and that inner div is going to have a class name equal to product Dash card	-
5:37:19	inside of there we can of course render the product image that's going to be a	-
5:37:24	basic IMG tag that's going to have the source equal to url4	-
5:37:29	and then we're going to check if we have an image so image and end and if we do	-
5:37:34	we can return the first image because we're going to have multiple images for	-
5:37:39	each one of our products we can also set the width and the height for our image	-
5:37:45	to be around 250 pixels so there we go width and height and finally we can	-
5:37:53	apply a class name equal to product Dash image now if we save this you can see	-
5:38:01	our great headphones appear right here with this nice hover effect of course	-
5:38:06	let's also display the name and the price below our image that's going to be	-
5:38:11	a class name equal to product Dash name and there we can render out the name	-
5:38:17	which we just structured from the product there we go headphones and we	-
5:38:21	can also duplicate that and render out the product price where we're going to	-
5:38:27	add the price but we're gonna also add the dollar sign	-
5:38:30	in front 99 bucks there we go of course these	-
5:38:36	headphones look just a bit lonely so what we can do now is we can go to our	-
5:38:41	sanity Studio or sanity desk and we can immediately add many more products with	-
5:38:47	ease so let's go here to new product and we can just start adding them as I've	-
5:38:53	promised I'm going to leave a link to a zipped assets folder down below so you	-
5:38:58	should be able to replicate each product in its entirety let's start with this	-
5:39:04	great speaker right here I'll try drag and dropping some images right here	-
5:39:09	there we go we have speaker one two three and four we're going to add a name	-
5:39:15	let's do something like speaker we're not really Innovative here	-
5:39:19	and we can automatically generate a slug the price in this case can be something	-
5:39:24	like 56 bucks and we can also add some details I'm going to say immerse in The	-
5:39:32	Amazing sound there we go and let's click publish this is going to be our	-
5:39:37	second product we can just keep going through it because it is so easy so	-
5:39:42	let's go ahead and add a few more products I'm going to go with these	-
5:39:46	headphones right here there we go drag and drop these are	-
5:39:51	going to be headphones as well but look at this now if we try to generate a slug	-
5:39:57	it says that the slack is already in use so we have to say something like	-
5:40:01	headphones new or headphones C or whatever you want to use the price can	-
5:40:07	be something like 55 bucks and this is going to be a second pair of headphones	-
5:40:14	and we can publish it let's keep going through it let's add a	-
5:40:18	few more items let's add some of these in-ear headphones right here	-
5:40:23	again drag and drop enter the product name cool in ear headphones	-
5:40:31	slide can be automatically generated as you can see price is going to be	-
5:40:35	something around 40 bucks and the details are going to be use these while	-
5:40:41	working out there we go and let's publish	
5:40:45	four products should be enough to start with so let's go back to our localhost	-
5:40:50	3000 and let's simply pre-load the page would you look at that we instantly get	-
5:40:58	more products if the initial reload didn't work for you you might have not	-
5:41:03	known about this but you can press Ctrl shift and then R this is going to	-
5:41:09	trigger a hard reload which is going to clear the cache as well so one more time	-
5:41:14	if the general reload doesn't work Ctrl shift and then R to trigger a hard	-
5:41:19	reload with the cash trigger that also reloads the cash great so now believe it	-
5:41:26	or not we are done with our products we can go back to our index where we just	-
5:41:32	have one thing left to do and that is the footer Banner so let's go into the	-
5:41:37	footer Banner component so let's first pass some data into the footer Banner	-
5:41:42	component we can see something like footer Banner	
5:41:46	is equal to if Banner data exists so Banner data and end in that case we can	-
5:41:53	pass Banner data zero so the first instance	
5:41:57	now we can go into it we can accept that footer Banner right here	-
5:42:03	and we can also import same as before link from next forward slash link	-
5:42:11	and we can also import that URL for that we use for images from Dada slash lib	-
5:42:18	forward slash client I just wanted to show you a finished version of our	-
5:42:24	application as you can see right here we have this great Banner we also have our	-
5:42:29	products and then we have this great looking footer Banner this is exactly	-
5:42:35	what we're working on at the moment so let's go back to our local host and	-
5:42:39	let's implement it right away we can start by adding a class name to	-
5:42:45	this div that class name is going to be footer	-
5:42:49	Dash Banner Dash container inside of there we're going to have one	-
5:42:54	more div and this div is going to have a class name equal to Banner Dash d-e-s-c	-
5:43:02	as in description and inside of there we're gonna have two more divs the first	-
5:43:09	div is going to have a class name equal to left	-
5:43:14	and the second one right here I guess you can guess it is going to	-
5:43:19	have a class name equal to right if we save that you can see this red color	-
5:43:26	appear right here that is coming from the footer Banner container and inside	-
5:43:31	of the left we can render a P tag that's going to render the footer Banner dot	-
5:43:38	discount there we go you can see twenty percent	
5:43:42	off below this discount we're going to have an H3 element so let's change this	-
5:43:47	to H3 and there we're going to render the large text one	-
5:43:53	fine there we go we can duplicate that and render the large text too	-
5:43:59	fine smile and finally we're going to render one last P tag where we're going	-
5:44:05	to render the sale time there we go so as you can see we have	-
5:44:10	this nice text with some words right here again just basic placeholder we	-
5:44:15	have the percentage off and we have the sale time great but as you can see we	-
5:44:20	are repeating ourselves quite a lot here so it might be a good idea to	-
5:44:24	destructure all the properties from our footer Banner we can do that by saying	-
5:44:29	colon and then a pair of curly braces and we can take all of the values	-
5:44:32	outside of it discount large	
5:44:36	text one large text to	-
5:44:42	sale time small text is also going to be here as	-
5:44:48	well as the mid text finally the product	-
5:44:52	the button text and last but not least we're gonna have	-
5:44:57	our product image there we go	-
5:45:00	so now we don't have to reference the footer Banner each time we can simply	-
5:45:05	use the actual text elements there we go looking much better now inside of the	-
5:45:12	right we're going to have another P tag that's going to render the small text	-
5:45:17	like this there we go we want to go below with	-
5:45:22	another H3 that is going to render the mid text this time	-
5:45:27	there we go and finally we're going to have one more P tag that's going to	-
5:45:32	render the desc or a description I don't think we've taken that out from the	-
5:45:37	footer so let's take it out right here below that P tag we're going to have our	-
5:45:43	link as we already know each link has an href	
5:45:47	tag that is dynamic in this case and we're going to point out to product	-
5:45:52	forward slash dollar sign Crayola braces product	-
5:45:56	that's going to be the link to our specific product and inside of that link	-
5:46:01	we want to render a button component that button is going to be of a type is	-
5:46:07	equal to button and also we're going to render the	-
5:46:11	button text right inside of it there we go shop now this is looking great now	-
5:46:19	below this div of class name right we're going to add our image	-
5:46:24	our image is going to have the SRC property equal to url4 and then simply	-
5:46:31	we're gonna pass in the image we're going to also provide a class name equal	-
5:46:37	to that's going to be footer Dash Banner Dash image and let's save it there we go	-
5:46:44	this is going to make our headphones float on top of this Banner but as you	-
5:46:49	can see something still doesn't feel right our Banner is at the top we are	-
5:46:54	missing our navigation bar and our footer Banner is also going all the way	-
5:46:59	from left Edge to right Edge so let's go ahead and fix that by working on the	-
5:47:06	layout component a really important component in every application we can go	-
5:47:12	to our layout component and start implementing it right away	-
5:47:16	our layout is going to import a special component called Head from next forward	-
5:47:23	slash head head is the same thing as head is in HTML that head element that	-
5:47:30	appears above the body that gives you some metadata about your website in	-
5:47:34	next.js you just have to import it like this	
5:47:38	inside of the layout what we can do is render out a div and that div is going	-
5:47:44	to have a class name right here equal to layout	-
5:47:50	inside of there we're going to have a head element right here	-
5:47:55	and to that head element we're going to add a title of our store name let's do	-
5:48:00	JS mastery store	
5:48:03	there we go if you save this now you won't see changes yet because we're not	-
5:48:08	yet using this layout component but we will soon again feel free to use your	-
5:48:13	own name right here below our head we're going to call the	-
5:48:17	HTML5 semantic header tag and inside of there we want to render the navbar	-
5:48:23	component this is of course component that we are going to create on our own	-
5:48:28	what you can do to instantly import it is press control space and then click	-
5:48:34	right here that's going to import navbar straight from that slash knob bar so	-
5:48:40	once again that's a cool little trick that I recently found out about double	-
5:48:44	click the word and then Ctrl space and then it's going to suggest the import if	-
5:48:49	it didn't work automatically for you no worries just manually import it right	-
5:48:53	here below our header we're going to have our	
5:48:57	main section which is going to have a class name equal to main Dash container	-
5:49:04	and inside of there for now I'm simply going to say empty you're going to see	-
5:49:10	later on what we want to put inside of here	
5:49:13	and finally of course we need to have a footer so inside of that footer we're	-
5:49:18	going to render a footer component again control space and click right here	-
5:49:24	to import it from the dot slash footer now if we do that you still won't see	-
5:49:30	any changes because we're not using this layout component anywhere where we need	-
5:49:35	to use it though is the underscore app.js	
5:49:40	right now right here we're just returning a single component but that	-
5:49:45	component doesn't have a footer doesn't have a nav bar it doesn't essentially	-
5:49:49	have anything so what we can do right here is import	-
5:49:56	in curly braces layout from dot slash components	-
5:50:04	and now we can wrap this entire component	-
5:50:08	and by the way this component means the component that we're currently on so if	-
5:50:13	we're on a product Details page that's going to be this component if you're in	-
5:50:17	the home page that's going to be this component right here so what we want to	-
5:50:22	do is we want to wrap our current component or current page with the	-
5:50:27	layout component as soon as we do this and press save you're going to notice	-
5:50:31	that now we have navbar footer and then empty now how do we make this component	-
5:50:38	actually appear inside of our layout well a special trick in react is	-
5:50:45	whenever you pass to inside of your component you get access to that through	-
5:50:50	a prop called children so we're going to get access to this component through	-
5:50:56	props called children and we can render those children right here right away	-
5:51:02	and now we get back to our beautiful website we've created but now we	-
5:51:06	actually have this navigation bar at the top although it's not yet styled we have	-
5:51:10	some space and margin between the left and right side from our Banner and also	-
5:51:16	the same thing is happening at the bottom and we have our footer right here	-
5:51:21	so what we can do is collapse this back again and we can start implementing the	-
5:51:27	navbar and the footer component these are going to be really straightforward	-
5:51:33	so don't worry about that trust me soon enough we'll be doing the stripe	-
5:51:38	integration where we'll be able to buy all of these products for real	-
5:51:44	so let's start with the navigation bar you can control click into it	-
5:51:49	and we're going to start with importing a few Necessary Things these are going	-
5:51:53	to be of course link coming from next forward slash link	-
5:51:59	and we're going to also import AI outline shopping	-
5:52:06	from react Dash icons	
5:52:11	forward slash AI That's just a simple shopping icon this is going to be all	-
5:52:17	that we're going to need for now so what we can do is we can start implementing	-
5:52:22	this jsx we're going to have a div and that div is going to have a class name	-
5:52:28	equal to navbar Dash container	-
5:52:32	inside of there we're going to have a P tag and that P tag is going to contain a	-
5:52:39	link and that link is simply going to have an	
5:52:42	href 2 forward slash in here we can enter the name of our store I'm going to	-
5:52:48	say JSM headphones since that's what we're selling right	-
5:52:53	here there we go and we can also give a class name to this B tag which is going	-
5:53:00	to be logo that's just going to make it a bit grayer and add some space below	-
5:53:06	this P tag we can also add a button that button is going to have a type	-
5:53:12	which is equal to button and it's also going to have a class name equal to cart	-
5:53:19	Dash icon that button is going to open up the cart	-
5:53:23	so later on we're going to add an on click functionality here for now I'm	-
5:53:28	going to let that be empty inside of that button we're going to have the AI	-
5:53:33	outline shopping icon and we're gonna also have a span element	-
5:53:39	that's going to say class name cart Dash item Dash qty which stands for	-
5:53:47	quantity and there we want to render the total	
5:53:50	quantity of the item for now let's simply hard code it to something like	-
5:53:55	one and there we go you can see this	
5:53:58	shopping cart icon appear on the top right and it says one right here that is	-
5:54:05	going to be all that we're going to implement for now because later on we're	-
5:54:09	going to implement the context in our entire application and then we'll be	-
5:54:13	able to change this quantity dynamically so far we're gonna leave it static and	-
5:54:18	that is completely fine because we're definitely going to come back to this	-
5:54:22	component now we can go back to the layout and	
5:54:26	transition to our footer component which also shouldn't be that hard actually it	-
5:54:32	is so much simpler we can first import a few icons by saying import AI fill	-
5:54:39	Instagram and also AI outline Twitter and that's coming from react Dash icons	-
5:54:49	forward slash AI inside of here we can add a class name to our div and that	-
5:54:57	class name is going to be footer Dash container	
5:55:01	inside of there we're going to have a P tag and there we can simply say	-
5:55:06	something like 2022 and then JSM headphones	
5:55:11	and then as you know all rights reserved just to make it seem a bit more official	-
5:55:20	now if you scroll down you can see that right here we can also add another P tag	-
5:55:27	that's going to have a class name equal to icons	-
5:55:31	and in there we can render the AI fill Instagram and also AI fill Twitter	-
5:55:41	there we go render it looks like I forgot something	-
5:55:45	that was AI outline Twitter there we go and you can see those icons appear right	-
5:55:52	here so now we kind of pointed out that this is the end of the website we have	-
5:55:56	this great looking footer at the bottom this phenomenal looking Banner with	-
5:56:01	floating headphones we have our best selling products as you can see right	-
5:56:05	here we have our summer sale product right here and the navigation bar that	-
5:56:11	has the number of items in our cart everything is looking great so far the	-
5:56:18	next thing we're gonna do is implement the product Details page as you can see	-
5:56:23	if we go to product and then speaker now you're gonna see that we're gonna get a	-
5:56:28	404. this page could not be found so what we're going to do now is we're	-
5:56:34	gonna implement it fetch all the data about the product all of its images and	-
5:56:39	everything else that belongs to it we're gonna also add some scroll for the the	-
5:56:44	recommended products and I'm going to make it really exciting for you guys so	-
5:56:49	let's collapse this let's close all of our currently open files by going to	-
5:56:54	visual studio code and then holding control and pressing w a few times we	-
5:56:59	always want to have a clean working environment	
5:57:02	so let's go to e-commerce let's go to pages and the next step is to implement	-
5:57:09	that product Details page in next.js you can do it like this we can right click	-
5:57:15	Pages we can create a new folder called Product	
5:57:20	and then we can create a new file inside of that product folder and you can use	-
5:57:25	square brackets inside of there you can say slug remember slag is that unique	-
5:57:32	identifier that belongs to each product and we say dot Js	-
5:57:38	so we're going to create a slack.js file inside of the product folder the fact	-
5:57:44	that it is inside of square brackets means that it is going to be dynamic so	-
5:57:49	for example we can go to product and then speaker or product for slash	-
5:57:53	headphones it's going to dynamically render it we can of course start with	-
5:57:58	that rafce to quickly implement it but of course the component is going to be	-
5:58:04	called Product details right here and made to export the product details for	-
5:58:12	now inside of there let's simply say product like this and let's save it	-
5:58:18	now as you can see we no longer have a 404 rather if we click on a specific	-
5:58:24	product like headphones we can see the product right here which means that	-
5:58:29	we're successfully rendering the product Details page and that is the beauty of	-
5:58:34	file based routing in xjs we didn't have to implement any kind of Library like	-
5:58:40	react router we just created a new folder with a specific file name and we	-
5:58:46	can immediately start creating the jsx and the logic for that component isn't	-
5:58:52	that great let's start with implementing our product details component we're	-
5:58:57	gonna have one root div inside of which we're gonna have one	-
5:59:03	more div and that div is going to have a class name equal to product Dash detail	-
5:59:09	Dash container that product details container is going	-
5:59:14	to have one more div inside of it and inside of that inner div we're going to	-
5:59:19	have believe it or not yet another final div this is going to be the div that's	-
5:59:25	going to contain the image so we can give it a class name equal to image Dash	-
5:59:31	container instead of there we can render our image	
5:59:35	tag by creating the IMG closing it and then referencing its source	-
5:59:42	of course we can get the source by using that URL from coming from sanity so we	-
5:59:49	can import both the client and the URL for from dot slash dot slash lib forward	-
5:59:58	slash client but now of course the question is how are we going to get the	-
6:00:03	image of this specific product how is next.js or sanity going to know if we	-
6:00:10	clicked on this speaker right here or on these headphones right here	-
6:00:15	well we can get it by of course making an API call to get this specific product	-
6:00:21	and if you think about it we've done something like that before if we go to	-
6:00:26	our index.js and scroll down we have this get server side props function	-
6:00:31	where we're fetching all the products we're going to copy this entire get	-
6:00:36	server-side props go back to Slug and paste it right here	-
6:00:41	but this time opposed to using the get server-side props we're gonna use the	-
6:00:47	get static prompts which is another special next.js function	-
6:00:52	if we quickly Google it we're gonna see that get static props is a function that	-
6:00:58	is used when we want to pre-render the page at build time using the props	-
6:01:02	returned so when should we use it well we should use get static props if the	-
6:01:08	data required to render the page is available at build Time ahead of users	-
6:01:13	request and if the data comes from a headless CMS that is exactly what we're	-
6:01:20	trying to do so think about it if we're on the home page the user can click on	-
6:01:25	any of these pages so we should have the data already stored so that when we	-
6:01:31	click here everything is going to be populated instantly that's the whole	-
6:01:36	goal with get static props get static props also has one benefit inside of	-
6:01:42	here we can de-structure programs and then from outside of the params we can	-
6:01:47	get access to the actual URL query remember these square brackets and then	-
6:01:53	the slag in between well as I've told you that slack is going to be dynamic	-
6:01:58	that means that we're going to get access to whatever that slack is in this	-
6:02:04	case that's going to be headphones underscore new and we absolutely need	-
6:02:09	that because we need to know which product are we fetching the data for so	-
6:02:13	what we can do is we can modify this query by first making it a template	-
6:02:17	string using back text and then we're trying to get the product but we're	-
6:02:23	going to say end end slug dot current is equal to and then in single quota	-
6:02:30	strings dollar sign curly braces slug and then we close it go outside of the	-
6:02:39	entire square brackets and then say zero because we only want to fetch the first	-
6:02:44	product that matches this query so this is going to be used to fetch product	-
6:02:49	details from the product page that we are on	-
6:02:53	the other hand we'll also want to fetch all similar products so to do that we	-
6:02:57	can write another query const products query is equal to	-
6:03:03	that's going to be a string where we have asterisk square brackets underscore	-
6:03:08	type is equal to product and that's it we're gonna fetch all of the products so	-
6:03:15	now that we have that we can actually say const product is equal to a weight	-
6:03:21	client that fetch query to get the individual product and then we can also	-
6:03:26	say cost products is equal to a weight client that Fetch and that's going to be	-
6:03:33	products query with that we have everything we need so	-
6:03:39	we can simply return products and also the product	-
6:03:43	great and as with the get server side props all of these values are going to	-
6:03:49	be delivered straight for us right here inside of the props so we're gonna get	-
6:03:53	product and also products great with that we can immediately destructure the	-
6:04:00	values from the product by saying const image name details and price is equal to	-
6:04:08	product that way we don't have to repeat ourselves product.image product.name and	-
6:04:14	so on we can immediately get them and remember we wanted to render our	-
6:04:20	image so what we can do is we can say source	
6:04:24	url4 and then if there is an image so image and end then we want to get image	-
6:04:31	under the specific Index this index is going to be changed every time because	-
6:04:37	we'll be able to Traverse through multiple images but for now let's simply	-
6:04:42	try to get the image 0 and as soon as we've saved that we get an error cannot	-
6:04:49	destructure image of product as it is undefined	
6:04:53	let's see if we're properly passing it back here we have return props and then	-
6:04:59	an object that returns products and a single product what we can do is we can	-
6:05:05	console log the actual product right here to see if we're getting any data	-
6:05:11	back and finally nextges gave us a beautiful hand really descriptive error	-
6:05:17	get static paths is required for dynamic server-side generation pages and is	-
6:05:25	missing for product slug you can read more here this is really interesting	-
6:05:30	essentially it's saying that when we use get static props we also need to add one	-
6:05:37	extra special next JS function called get static paths so if we go right here	-
6:05:43	and search for get static pads we can learn more about it	-
6:05:48	if a page has Dynamic routes and uses get static props it needs to define a	-
6:05:55	list of paths to be statically generated again think about it if we are at our	-
6:06:01	localhost 3000 right here we need to already know that the user can click	-
6:06:07	here here here and here and for our page to be incredibly optimized nextgs	-
6:06:13	immediately needs to know that all of these Pages can be clicked on then it's	-
6:06:19	going to immediately show us the data but now since we're going to have	-
6:06:23	multiple other links in the product Details page like the ability to visit	-
6:06:29	additional products that we might like then we need to also repeat the process	-
6:06:34	for them so that nextgis can prepare all of that data and deliver it as quickly	-
6:06:39	as possible so to fix that we can say export const	-
6:06:45	get static paths is equal to an async function right here	-
6:06:52	and there we also have to write the query we can say const query is equal to	-
6:06:57	a template string get everything where underscore type is equal to	-
6:07:05	product so we're trying to get all of the products and then we can go into a	-
6:07:09	new line we can open up a pair of curly braces right here	-
6:07:13	and we only need to get one thing just get the slug more specifically just get	-
6:07:19	the current property of a slug of each one of these products so again sanity's	-
6:07:26	language is incredibly easy to understand it is similar to graphql but	-
6:07:31	it is an optimized version of it so we're saying give me all the products	-
6:07:36	but don't return all of the data for all the products just return the current	-
6:07:40	slug property that's it based on that query we can say cons products is equal	-
6:07:47	to a weight client dot fetch we pass in that query and then we can generate our	-
6:07:54	paths const paths is equal to products.map	
6:07:59	we get each individual product which is essentially just a product Slug and then	-
6:08:05	we want to instantly return an object so this is not going to be just a curly	-
6:08:10	brace we need to add parentheses and then a pair of curly braces this means	-
6:08:15	that we are instantly returning an object from a function that object is	-
6:08:20	going to have a params object and inside of there we're going to have	-
6:08:25	a slug which we're going to set to be product dot slug dot current	-
6:08:31	great finally what we have to do is return an object that contains the paths	-
6:08:38	and also a fallback that is going to be set to blocking	-
6:08:43	there we go of course if you want to read more about this just go to get	-
6:08:48	static pads and search for blocking it is one of the ways in which you can set	-
6:08:53	the fallback now if we save this you can see that we get our great headphones	-
6:08:59	image and we are ready to continue with the rest of the product Details page	-
6:09:05	amazing below the div containing our image we're going to have one more div	-
6:09:11	and this div is going to be for our image Carousel so we can say class name	-
6:09:16	small Dash Images dash container inside of there we can open a dynamic	-
6:09:24	block of code and we can say image question mark dot map we're going to	-
6:09:29	Loop through each individual item we're going to also get the index	-
6:09:34	and then for each item we of course want to return an IMG tag	-
6:09:39	that image is going to have a source equal to URL for and then we pass in the	-
6:09:46	item later on we're going to also provide a dynamic class name here as	-
6:09:51	well as on Mouse enter property this is going to allow us to select an image as	-
6:09:58	you can see right here on Hover and make it visible on this bigger display that	-
6:10:04	way everything is going to seem fluent and it's going to allow users to better	-
6:10:09	see what products are you selling we're going to leave this functionality empty	-
6:10:14	for now while we implement the rest of the layout and then we're going to go	-
6:10:19	back to it for now we can comment out this entire div because we don't need	-
6:10:23	two of the same images below this div containing both of our images we're	-
6:10:29	going to have one more div and this div is going to have a class name equal to	-
6:10:36	product Dash details Dash d-e-s-c as in description of course inside of there	-
6:10:43	we're going to render an H1 tag this H1 is going to render the product's	-
6:10:50	name so we can simply say name right here as we have already the structured	-
6:10:55	it before headphones great we also want to render some kind of	-
6:11:00	reviews right so below this H1 we can render a div that's going to have a	-
6:11:06	class name equal to reviews inside of there we can render a single div that's	-
6:11:12	going to have a few icons so let's go ahead and import the icons right away	-
6:11:18	we're gonna import AI outline minus AI outline plus a I	-
6:11:27	fill star AI outline star and all of these icons	-
6:11:34	are coming from react Dash icons forward slash AI	-
6:11:40	now we can go back and right here we can render let's do	-
6:11:46	five of these AI fill star self closing component and let's repeat it four more	-
6:11:54	times let's save it there we go the last one can be let's do AI outline	-
6:12:02	star because maybe some people didn't like these headphones so they're gonna	-
6:12:07	have four stars below this div we're gonna have a P tag	-
6:12:12	it's going to have the number 20 in parentheses this is going to be the	-
6:12:16	number of reviews finally we're gonna go below this div and we're going to render	-
6:12:22	an H4 element that's going to say details under that H4 we can render a P	-
6:12:28	tag that's going to dynamically render all of the details about our headphones	-
6:12:33	great looking hand sounding headphones of course what would an e-commerce store	-
6:12:38	be without the price so we can say class name is going to be price on the speed	-
6:12:45	tag and there we can render a dollar sign and then render the item's price 99	-
6:12:51	bucks great below that P tag we're going to render a div that's going to have a	-
6:12:57	class name equal to quantity inside of there we're going to render an	-
6:13:03	H3 element and that H3 is going to say Quantity and right below we can render a	-
6:13:10	P tag now this B tag is going to have a few span elements inside of it and it's	-
6:13:16	also going to have a class name equal to quantity Dash description or desc inside	-
6:13:24	of there we can render a few span elements the first one is going to have	-
6:13:29	a class name equal to minus	-
6:13:33	and it's also going to have an on click property which is now going to be an	-
6:13:38	empty string we're going to implement it soon enough there we can render the AI	-
6:13:43	outline minus icon there we go as you can see we have this	-
6:13:49	great minus right here which we cannot yet click now we're going to duplicate	-
6:13:54	this two more times the second class name is going to say	-
6:13:58	num as a number and it's going to render the actual	-
6:14:03	quantity for now let's say it's zero and finally	
6:14:07	the last one is going to say plus and it's going to render the AI outline plus	-
6:14:13	icon and there we go we have this great	
6:14:17	looking rectangle which is not yet functional but will be soon and it looks	-
6:14:22	like our actual rectangle is expanding a bit too much we're definitely going to	-
6:14:28	fix this soon but before that let's Implement our add to cart and buy now	-
6:14:34	buttons we can do that just below our quantity we're going to add a div and	-
6:14:40	this div is going to have a class name which is going to be equal to buttons	-
6:14:46	there we can render the initial button which is of course going to be of a type	-
6:14:52	is equal to button and it's going to have a class name	-
6:14:57	equal to add Dash to dash cart we're going to also add the non-click which is	-
6:15:05	going to be equal to an empty string for now and inside of there we can say add	-
6:15:10	to cart there we go we have this nice add to	-
6:15:14	cart button and we're going to duplicate it just below the second one is going to	-
6:15:19	be the buy now button so let's say class Name by Dash now	-
6:15:25	and we're going to also change the text to B bye now	-
6:15:29	there we go now we have these two great looking buttons as you can see right	-
6:15:35	here finally let's fix this quantity right here as well as the spacing	-
6:15:40	between the details and the quantity and to fix that spacing we have to go up and	-
6:15:46	change the class name from the outer div being product details description to	-
6:15:51	product Dash detail description that's going to immediately change this and	-
6:15:56	everything will be looking great as we have this nice rectangle with minus plus	-
6:16:01	also the price and two buttons right here	
6:16:06	now we can also implement the recommended items or you may also like	-
6:16:12	section that is nicely scrolling around here	
6:16:16	to do that we can go back to our code and go all the way down below our	-
6:16:22	buttons we're going to go a few divs down so one div down two divs and then	-
6:16:28	the third div below this we're going to implement another div this div is going	-
6:16:35	to have a class name equal to may like Dash products Dash wrapper inside of	-
6:16:41	there we're gonna add an H2 that's going to say you may also like	-
6:16:48	there we go and there we're going to render a div that's going to have a	-
6:16:54	class name equal to Marquee like this Marquee essentially	-
6:17:01	stands for a scrolling part most often referred to as a list of scrolling divs	-
6:17:07	and inside of that div we're going to have one more div that's going to have a	-
6:17:13	class name equal to may like Dash products Dash container and inside of	-
6:17:21	there we're gonna open a dynamic block of code we're gonna take all of our	-
6:17:25	products and map over them we're gonna get our individual item and for each	-
6:17:32	item we want to return well a self-closing product component remember	-
6:17:38	this product is a component that we have already created so we can import it	-
6:17:43	right at the top right here we can say Import in curly braces product which is	-
6:17:49	coming from from dot slash dot dot slash components	
6:17:55	there we go and as soon as we do that it looks like we get another error Kenneth	-
6:18:01	read properties of undefined reading image well let's just finish adding our	-
6:18:07	product component right here product and the only thing we have to do	-
6:18:12	is pass in a key which is going to be item dot underscore and then that's	-
6:18:18	going to be ID and we also need to provide the product itself which is	-
6:18:23	going to be equal to item and as you can see once we do that and reload the page	-
6:18:28	we have these great products listed right here	-
6:18:33	and to make these products move around we have to add just one extra class	-
6:18:37	which is track as soon as we do that you'll notice that	-
6:18:42	these products will start moving around and once you actually find the one	-
6:18:46	you're interested in you can just simply hover over with your mouse and you can	-
6:18:50	select it isn't this great with that we are almost done with our	-
6:18:57	product details component the last thing we have to do is to implement the larger	-
6:19:04	image functionality so the small image Carousel and then once we actually hover	-
6:19:09	over it we want to be able to see it in more detail so to implement that we'll	-
6:19:15	have to add a state to our application we can import use state from react	-
6:19:23	and we can create a new State field const index and set index is equal to	-
6:19:31	use State and at the start we want to look at the image under the index of 0.	-
6:19:38	so now we can replace this static 0 with the index right here and nothing should	-
6:19:44	change once we've done that we can bring into play R Carousel div right here	-
6:19:50	now we can notice that we have a few images hence something started breaking	-
6:19:55	immediately this is not looking great but what we can do is we can add a	-
6:20:02	function on Mouse enter which is going to be equal to a callback function where	-
6:20:08	we set index to be equal to and then we get the individual index of the item we	-
6:20:14	are looking after finally based on that index we can provide a dynamic class	-
6:20:20	name so we can say if I meaning the current index is equal to the index we	-
6:20:26	want to see in detail then we can provide a small Dash image and also	-
6:20:33	selected Dash image class names else we're simply going to provide the small	-
6:20:39	image now if we save that you're going to notice that this one is currently	-
6:20:44	selected and if we hover over it you're going to notice that different ones get	-
6:20:48	selected but all of these images are of a	
6:20:52	different size so something kind of seems to be jumping around and it	-
6:20:56	doesn't look good let's go ahead and fix that right away the last thing we have	-
6:21:01	to do is apply a class name to our image which is going to be product Dash detail	-
6:21:09	Dash image now we're not talking about smaller Carousel images we're talking	-
6:21:15	about our main product detail image now it is nicely structured and if we hover	-
6:21:21	over them they'll all be of the same size this is looking great as you can	-
6:21:28	see we can also move through different products	
6:21:31	and this is actually working right off the bat because we have implemented that	-
6:21:37	routing also notice how quick that is if I click right here it opens it up and we	-
6:21:43	can immediately see our application in its full Glory all of these details are	-
6:21:49	changing dynamically you can see speakers details the price that's all	-
6:21:54	being pulled straight from sanity one thing that is currently not Dynamic here	-
6:21:59	would be the reviews but again feel free to modify it however you'd like you can	-
6:22:05	make everything absolutely 100 Dynamic using sanity you can even go a step	-
6:22:12	further and to each product not just show all of the products just show the	-
6:22:18	ones related to that one or create similar products or create products that	-
6:22:24	work well together and say hey add this one you might like it as well so there's	-
6:22:30	really a lot of possibility is that you can do with sanity and especially in the	-
6:22:35	e-commerce field this is already looking great we have our basic homepage fully	-
6:22:41	done as well as the navbar footer all of these banners and finally also the	-
6:22:48	product Details page this is looking great	
6:22:53	and would you agree that now is the time that we start implementing real logic	-
6:22:59	I'm talking adding items to the cart buying them right away changing	-
6:23:04	quantities updating the number of items in the cart and actually displaying the	-
6:23:09	card component as well all of that is coming right up because we're going to	-
6:23:15	implement react context a single source of data for our entire application	-
6:23:23	so managing the react State using react context coming right up stay tuned	-
6:23:30	you're gonna learn a lot and we're really going to make our application	-
6:23:34	Dynamic to start working on our context and our logic we can go to our	-
6:23:40	e-commerce folder and create a new folder right here it's going to be	-
6:23:45	called context inside of that context folder we're going to create a new file	-
6:23:51	called State context because in here we're going to manage the entire state	-
6:23:57	of our application state context.js inside of here we can immediately import	-
6:24:03	some things such as react and we're gonna use quite a lot of hooks	-
6:24:09	in curly braces create context use context use State and	-
6:24:17	use effect all of that is coming from react so as you can see we're gonna	-
6:24:23	definitely deal with a lot of logic here we're going to also Import in curler	-
6:24:29	braces a toast from react Dash hot Dash toast this is going to be that little	-
6:24:36	pop-up notification that's going to appear whenever we add something to the	-
6:24:40	card remove it or finish the order now that we have our Imports we can say	-
6:24:45	cons context is equal to create context and we call that as a hook and below our	-
6:24:52	context we're going to create our context functional component by saying	-
6:24:56	export const State context is equal to and then a regular Arrow function	-
6:25:04	inside of here we're getting one really important prop which is called children	-
6:25:09	this means that whenever we call our state context like this whatever we pass	-
6:25:14	into it is going to be considered children and we can render it out so now	-
6:25:20	we can continue with it and what are we going to have in our context well first	-
6:25:25	of all there's going to be a lot of different states so let's start with	-
6:25:29	that we can create our first use state by using the use State snippet and it's	-
6:25:35	going to be called show cart so at the start that is going to be set	-
6:25:40	to false are we currently showing the card or are we not we need to manage	-
6:25:44	that state we're going to do the same thing so use State snippet 4 cart items	-
6:25:51	and Set Card items we always need to know what items do we have in our cart	-
6:25:57	and at the start we're going to leave it empty because soon enough we're going to	-
6:26:01	fill it with the data coming from local storage so that's another thing I forgot	-
6:26:05	to mention we are even including local storage so if a user exits the page and	-
6:26:11	comes back all of his data will remain in exactly the state it was before they	-
6:26:16	left we also need to keep track of the total price so let's create a new use	-
6:26:21	State snippet total price like this and it's also going to be empty at the start	-
6:26:27	we need to keep it going because we have quite a lot of States then we're going	-
6:26:32	to have total quantities we need to know what are the quantities of all items	-
6:26:37	that we work with and finally we need to have one last	-
6:26:42	final State that's going to be qty which stands for quantity and at the start	-
6:26:48	that's going to be set to 1 because we can change the quantity for each	-
6:26:52	individual item finally we can create our context Provider by specifying a	-
6:26:59	return statement right here and then what we can return is going to be	-
6:27:03	context dot provider and then inside of there we're gonna pass in our children	-
6:27:10	so what this means is that we are essentially not rendering anything we're	-
6:27:15	just gonna wrap everything with our context provider and a really important	-
6:27:19	thing is that we're going to pass some values to it so we can say value and	-
6:27:24	then that's going to be an object of values that we want to pass across our	-
6:27:28	entire application let's start by passing all of our state Fields so	-
6:27:34	that's going to be show cart as well as cart items we also have the total price	-
6:27:41	total quantities and finally qty soon enough we'll be	-
6:27:47	able to access all of these values right away from absolutely any single one of	-
6:27:53	our components of course to make that happen we have to go into our pages and	-
6:27:58	then underscore app.js inside of here we have to wrap our entire application with	-
6:28:05	the state context and we can do that right here by saying Import in curly	-
6:28:11	braces State context from data slash context forward slash state context we	-
6:28:19	can simply call it as a function right here and as we discussed we need to wrap	-
6:28:25	our entire layout and our component with the state context this means that	-
6:28:30	nothing is going to change we simply want to pass the data from the state	-
6:28:34	context to every single component inside of it another thing we need to do to	-
6:28:40	make our small notification pop-up is import	
6:28:44	something known as a toaster which is coming from react Dash hot Dash	-
6:28:50	toast and we can put that right here we just	
6:28:54	need to add it right here above our component inside of the layout as a	-
6:28:59	self-closing component that's it and then all of the other data is going to	-
6:29:03	be managed straight inside of our state context let's Implement all of the	-
6:29:09	functionalities that we needed for our product Details page such as	-
6:29:13	incrementing the quantities and adding the items to the cart instead of Simply	-
6:29:18	passing the set quantity function to all of our components let's create our	-
6:29:22	Dynamic quantity update functions right here inside of our state context that	-
6:29:29	way we can provide just the final function to our product details	-
6:29:34	component let's do it like this create a new function const Inc qty as an	-
6:29:40	increased quantity and inside of there we're simply going	-
6:29:44	to create a callback function we're going to call the set quty State and	-
6:29:50	there we want to have a callback function because whenever you update the	-
6:29:55	state using the previous version of that same state so previous qty then we have	-
6:30:00	to use a callback function and we can simply say prev qty plus one	-
6:30:07	there we go and essentially we're going to do a similar thing for the decrease	-
6:30:12	quantity so I'm going to duplicate that change this to deck quantity or decrease	-
6:30:17	quantity and that's going to be previous quantity minus one but we have to have	-
6:30:23	one additional check so I'm going to expand this into a new function with a	-
6:30:29	function block like this and we're going to check	-
6:30:32	if prev quantity minus 1 is lower than one then we're going to Simply return	-
6:30:39	one because we cannot go lower than one and if that's not the case we're going	-
6:30:44	to return previous quantity minus one so we want to keep decrementing but if we	-
6:30:50	lower the number too much in that case we cannot go lower than one so now we	-
6:30:55	have our two functions and we're gonna also pass these functions to our Global	-
6:31:00	State increase quantity and also decrease quantity now we can finally go	-
6:31:06	to our product details so product and then Slug and we can for the first time	-
6:31:11	ever start using that Global state and its functions that we've created so to	-
6:31:18	do that we can import use State context and this is something that should be	-
6:31:25	coming from that dot slash data slash context and then State context	-
6:31:31	but to be completely honest I don't think we've yet exported it if you look	-
6:31:36	at this we don't have a variable called use State context we just have the state	-
6:31:41	context itself but we're going to go even one step further and we're going to	-
6:31:47	create a special function that is going to allow us to more easily grab the	-
6:31:52	state we can say export const use State	
6:31:56	context is equal to an error function that simply Returns the use context and	-
6:32:03	then we provide our own context great that is going to allow us to use our	-
6:32:09	state essentially just like a hook so right here we can say const we can	-
6:32:15	destructure the decrease quantity also increase quantity	-
6:32:21	and finally we can get the quantity itself and that is equal to use State	-
6:32:27	context there we go now we can use these functions right inside of our code so	-
6:32:34	where are we actually decrementing and incrementing it's right here so we have	-
6:32:39	our minus sign and on minus we're simply going to call decrease quantity right	-
6:32:45	here on our plus we're going to call the	
6:32:49	increase quantity so Inc q2y and then right here in the Middle where we have	-
6:32:54	our number we're simply going to render the qty	-
6:32:58	there we go so now as you can see we have one in the cart and if we keep	-
6:33:03	incrementing this number is going to change and these changes are reflected	-
6:33:08	in our entire application but right now we're not doing anything	-
6:33:12	with it because the add to cart and buy now buttons are not working so we have	-
6:33:18	to create a new function inside of our state context called on ADD what's going	-
6:33:25	to happen when we add it to the cart so right inside of our state context above	-
6:33:30	our increase and decrease quantity let's create a function called const on add	-
6:33:36	that function is going to accept two different parameters the first one is	-
6:33:41	going to be the product we want to add and the second one is going to be the	-
6:33:46	quantity we want to add so quantity there we go and inside of there	-
6:33:52	we first have to check if the product that we want to add is already in the	-
6:33:56	cart so let me expand the code since we'll be mostly dealing with logic now	-
6:34:01	that's going to be a bit tougher we have to say const check product	-
6:34:06	in cart so is the product already in cart we can do that by using the cart	-
6:34:13	item state DOT find and we Loop over all of the card items or we get the	-
6:34:19	individual item and we want to check if the item dot underscore ID is triple	-
6:34:25	equal to product dot underscore ID remember that product is coming from	-
6:34:31	here so we need to know is the item we're	
6:34:35	trying to add to cart already in the cart because if that is the case then we	-
6:34:40	simply need to increase the quantity and not add another instance of the same	-
6:34:45	item so we can say if check product in cart	
6:34:50	in that case we can simply increase the total price so set total price is going	-
6:34:57	to be a callback function where we get the previous total price	-
6:35:01	and we're going to set it to previous total price	-
6:35:07	product dot price times quantity so we're adding that new item and we	-
6:35:15	also need to set the total quantities which is another state that we have and	-
6:35:21	there we also need to get the previous total quantities and do the previous	-
6:35:26	total quantities plus the quantity of the new product so that's going to be	-
6:35:31	just quantity like this there we go because we are passing it	-
6:35:36	right as a prop so now that we updated our states we need to update the actual	-
6:35:42	items in the cart so we can say const updated cart items	-
6:35:48	and that's going to be equal to cart items.map so we want to map over our	-
6:35:54	current card items we get each individual cart product in there like	-
6:35:59	this and then we need to check if cart	
6:36:03	product dot underscore ID is equal to product dot underscore ID so that's the	-
6:36:10	product we are trying to add if it is equal then we can return	-
6:36:16	a new object which is going to spread the cart product but this time it's	-
6:36:24	going to update the quantity of that product to be cart product	-
6:36:30	dot quantity and then of course we're going to increase it by the new quantity	-
6:36:35	we're trying to add I know it's a bit complicated so let me try to bring this	-
6:36:40	back and bring us back to the finished site so that I can explain what we're	-
6:36:43	doing so we currently have four of these	
6:36:47	headphones let's say that we have just one if I go back and let's say that I	-
6:36:53	want to add another pair of these same headphones as you can see right here now	-
6:36:58	if I add another pair and if I click add to cart we don't want to add another one	-
6:37:05	of these items right here we need to recognize the fact that we already have	-
6:37:10	the same item and we simply want to increase the quantity right here and we	-
6:37:14	want to increase the price or the subtotal rather that's what we're	-
6:37:19	currently trying to do and then later on we're going to implement the	-
6:37:23	functionality to add a different item to the cart and as you can see it appears	-
6:37:27	below so with that in mind we now have our updated card items and the only	-
6:37:34	thing we have to do is set cart items to be updated card items and we can even	-
6:37:42	show the toast dot success so that's that little success message	-
6:37:48	and what we can say is qty and then product dot name	-
6:37:55	added to the cart there we go so this is going to happen if we're trying to add	-
6:38:01	an item that already exists in the cart but what if the item doesn't already	-
6:38:07	exist in the cart well in that case we can go inside of an	-
6:38:12	else statement right here and we would also have to update the total price and	-
6:38:17	total quantities so we can either duplicate that here or even better just	-
6:38:22	pull these two states above because we need them to happen both inside of an if	-
6:38:28	and also inside of an else the only thing we have to do if we don't	-
6:38:33	already have the item in the cart is update the product quantity so	-
6:38:38	product.quantity is going to become our new quantity	-
6:38:42	and then finally we need to set card items	
6:38:46	but this time we're going to set card items to B and empty array where we	-
6:38:51	spread all of the existing card items and then we add an object where we	-
6:38:56	spread our new product right here so a product with the updated quantity that	-
6:39:03	is it and then again we can render out this toast we can either duplicate it or	-
6:39:09	even smarter we can just pull this below our entire if and else so it's going to	-
6:39:14	happen in any case great and with that we should be able to	-
6:39:19	add the items to the cart so we're going to take this on ADD and we're going to	-
6:39:24	pass it through the value right here now we can pull it from our use State	-
6:39:31	context right here on ADD and finally we can use it inside of our ad to cart	-
6:39:38	button so right here we have our add to cart and on click I'm going to add a	-
6:39:46	callback function like this and then we want to call the	-
6:39:50	on ADD function but we need to provide the current product as the parameter as	-
6:39:56	well as the quantity that we want to add there we go	-
6:40:01	so now if we go back and if we go to our localhost 3000	-
6:40:06	I'll try to add two of these speakers you're going to see that currently we	-
6:40:11	have an error reading find of cart items so if we go to our state context that's	-
6:40:18	because cart items should at the start be an empty array so if we fix this and	-
6:40:24	add now you can see this little toast a notification appear one speaker added to	-
6:40:30	the cart but that's not really doing anything at	-
6:40:33	the moment because we have no way to look into the cart we haven't yet	-
6:40:37	implemented the cart component so now might be a great time to do that to	-
6:40:45	implement the card component we are going to go into our navigation bar so	-
6:40:51	we can go to components and then navbar right here we are going to import our	-
6:40:57	card component so Import in curly braces card from dot slash and what we can do	-
6:41:04	now is we can below this button simply render the self-closing card	-
6:41:12	component like this as you can see now there's a card there but our cart	-
6:41:17	shouldn't always be visible it's only visible when it is clicked as you can	-
6:41:22	see right here and we can close it so we have to somehow keep track of that	-
6:41:28	Global State and if you think about it we are already doing that we have this	-
6:41:34	show cart and set show card so what we can do is we can pass the set	-
6:41:40	show card as well through the values and then we can pull these values from our	-
6:41:46	navbar component remember how we've done it before we first need to import	-
6:41:51	use State context from dot slash context forward slash state context and then	-
6:42:00	right here we can say const show cart set show cart and also we're gonna need	-
6:42:09	total quantities and that's equal to use State context	-
6:42:15	the total quantities is going to be the number of all items in the cart so	-
6:42:19	however many items we have we need to know what is that number before that was	-
6:42:24	hard-coded here but now we can actually pass in a dynamic value there we go so	-
6:42:30	if we go back you can see that we have nothing number	-
6:42:34	at the moment but we can switch that to b0 at the start right here	-
6:42:40	and this is looking good then we're going to also make this	-
6:42:45	button close and open the cart on demand so let's create a callback function	-
6:42:50	right here and we're going to set show cart to be set to true so with this we	-
6:42:56	want to open it and then once we actually click outside of the cart we	-
6:43:00	want to close it and a really important detail we only want to show the card	-
6:43:05	when the show card is set to true so we can do show cart and end only then show	-
6:43:13	the card so now if we reload the page you're going to notice that there is no	-
6:43:18	cart but if we click right here the card shows up	-
6:43:21	currently the card is just a piece of text but we're going to fix it right	-
6:43:26	away because we are ready to start implementing our entire card component	-
6:43:33	let's go ahead and get started to start with our cart we can start with first	-
6:43:39	importing a few things because this is going to be a big component we're gonna	-
6:43:44	use the use ref hook right here as well as the link component coming from next	-
6:43:52	forward slash link we're going to also import the AI	-
6:43:56	outline minus icon AI outline plus icon AI outline left as well as AI outline	-
6:44:07	shopping and these icons are coming from react Dash icons forward slash AI	-
6:44:14	we need one another icon called Ti delete	
6:44:19	outline and this one is coming from react Dash icons forward slash TI we're	-
6:44:27	gonna also use that toast so we can say import toast from react hot toast	-
6:44:33	finally our cart is of course gonna use our context so we can say import use	-
6:44:40	State context and that is coming from dot dot slash context forward slash	-
6:44:48	state context we're going to also use some images so with sanity we have to	-
6:44:54	import the url4 coming from lib forward slash client there we go and I	-
6:45:02	think now we should have almost everything we need we can set up our	-
6:45:07	reference right here to our cart so we can say consc cart ref is equal to use	-
6:45:13	ref and then we'll leave it empty and we can also get all the data from our	-
6:45:19	context we're gonna get the total price like this let's also get the total	-
6:45:25	quantities we can also get the cart items and most	
6:45:30	importantly set show cart so that we can toggle it off and that's going to be it	-
6:45:37	for now that's gonna be coming from use State context and we call that as a hook	-
6:45:44	of course this was supposed to be use State context rather than content and	-
6:45:52	now we can start creating the jsx 4r cart	
6:45:56	first we're going to have one div that's going to be our wrapper so we can give	-
6:46:00	it a class name cart Dash wrapper we can also give it a ref equal to cart ref	-
6:46:07	you'll see soon enough why do we have to do that	-
6:46:11	inside of our wrapper we're gonna have another div and that div is going to	-
6:46:16	have a class name equal to cart Dash container inside of there we're gonna	-
6:46:22	have a button and this button is going to have a type	-
6:46:27	which is equal to of course you know it button it's going to have a class name	-
6:46:33	equal to cart Dash heading and then once we click here so on click we want to	-
6:46:40	call a callback function which is going to close our cart so we	-
6:46:45	can say set show cart is going to be set to false	-
6:46:51	there we go and inside of there we can render the AI outline left icon	-
6:46:59	as a self-closing tag and we can render two different span elements the first	-
6:47:05	one is going to say your cart and the second one is going to say	-
6:47:11	in parentheses total quantities	-
6:47:15	and also items so that we know how many items do we have	-
6:47:20	we can also give a class name to our first span which is going to be heading	-
6:47:26	and also we can give a class name to our second span which is going to be cart	-
6:47:31	Dash num Dash items now if we save this you can see that we already have our	-
6:47:39	great looking card so I'm going to pull our browser on the side once again so	-
6:47:44	that we can see the card in its full Glory of course now once we click here	-
6:47:48	you can see that it actually closes so we are one step closer on achieving our	-
6:47:54	card look feel and functionality now below our button we want to render of	-
6:48:00	course the cart items so we can say if cart items dot length	-
6:48:06	is lower than one in that case we want to show	-
6:48:11	some kind of a placeholder right that's going to be a div that's going to have a	-
6:48:17	class name equal to empty Dash cart inside of there we can render the AI	-
6:48:24	outline but this time that's going to be	
6:48:28	shopping and the size is going to be 150.	
6:48:33	there we go and we can also render an H3 right here	-
6:48:38	that H3 is going to say your shopping bag	
6:48:44	is empty there we go	-
6:48:47	save that looking good and finally we're going to provide a link	-
6:48:52	that's going to have an href to just forward slash and there we want to	-
6:48:58	render a button that's going to have a type is equal to	-
6:49:02	button and it's also going to have an on click	
6:49:08	which is going to have a callback function and there we also want to set	-
6:49:13	the show card to be set to false finally we can give it a class name equal to BTN	-
6:49:20	and inside of there we can say continue shopping	
6:49:25	there we go so now if I click here we close the cart and also if you click	-
6:49:30	here we close it and go back to our localhost 3000 or to our stores home	-
6:49:36	page but now what if we actually do have the items in our cart well we're going	-
6:49:43	to go below right here and we're going to create a new div which is going to be	-
6:49:48	called or rather it's going to have a class name equal to	-
6:49:52	product Dash container inside of here we can actually Loop through the products	-
6:49:58	so we can say if cart items dot length is greater than or equal to one in that	-
6:50:06	case we can render over the card items by calling the cart items dot map	-
6:50:12	property so we want to have an instant return	
6:50:15	here so instead of a curly brace we just have a parenthesis	-
6:50:19	and through each iteration of the map we're going to get the item as well as	-
6:50:24	the index and now the question is how is that returned item or product going to	-
6:50:30	look like well it's going to be a div first of all and let's indent it	-
6:50:35	properly that div is going to have a class name	
6:50:40	equal to product and we're going to also give it an ID or	-
6:50:46	rather a key which is going to be index if I'm not mistaken each one of our cart	-
6:50:52	items also has a ID property so we can also do a product or rather an item dot	-
6:51:00	underscore ID this is going to be even better whenever you have lists it's	-
6:51:05	always a good idea to use custom indexes instead of the ones that simply go from	-
6:51:10	0 to a specific number great so what's going to be inside of	-
6:51:16	our product well first of all an image this image is going to have a source	-
6:51:21	equal to url4 and then item question mark dot image zero so we want to render	-
6:51:29	the first products image and it's going to have a class name	-
6:51:33	equal to cart Dash product Dash image now if we save that and open up the cart	-
6:51:41	we should be able to see that right here of course we have to add something to	-
6:51:46	the cart first so this is the first time that we're actually checking if this	-
6:51:51	even works so let's add one of these to the cart one speaker added the number	-
6:51:57	changed here you can see that's the beautiful thing about context it is	-
6:52:01	global and whenever you do something here it immediately changes there as	-
6:52:06	well and there we go we can see our speaker image now below our image we're	-
6:52:12	going to have a div and that div is going to have a class name equal to item	-
6:52:17	Dash d-e-s-c as in description inside of there we're going to have	-
6:52:23	another div that's going to have a class name equal to flex space and then top as	-
6:52:29	well inside of there we can render an H5	
6:52:32	element and there we can render the item dot name	-
6:52:37	speaker there we go and below that we can render an H4 element right here	-
6:52:43	that's going to be dollar sign and then we can render the item dot price so now	-
6:52:48	we have the speaker and we have the price as well already looking great	-
6:52:54	below this div we're going to have another div that's going to have a class	-
6:52:58	name equal to flex and then bottom there we're going to render one div that's not	-
6:53:06	going to have a class name but inside of that div we're going to have a P tag	-
6:53:11	and that P tag is going to have a class name equal to quantity	-
6:53:18	Dash D E S C and if you remember correctly we had something that looked	-
6:53:23	exactly like this not that long ago I think it was in the product Details page	-
6:53:30	so in Pages product slug there we go quantity and there we have	-
6:53:36	our quantity description so we can copy this entire paragraph right here from	-
6:53:41	slug.js and paste it right here there we go	
6:53:47	now the problem is that as you can see the crease quantity is first of all not	-
6:53:53	defined but even if it were defined how would we know for which product are we	-
6:53:59	incrementing or decrementing the quantity because on our product page we	-
6:54:05	have only one single product if we go here you can see we have just the the	-
6:54:11	quantity update for the headphones but if we go to our cart we don't really	-
6:54:16	know what's going to happen are we gonna update the quantity for headphones or	-
6:54:21	for speakers so this is not going to work right out of the box so for now I'm	-
6:54:27	gonna simply remove the on click here by setting it to an	-
6:54:31	empty string and I'm going to also remove the quantity here rather set it	-
6:54:36	to zero and also do the same thing for the on click on the plus sign	-
6:54:42	if we do that and go back we can add to cart and you can see that we have our	-
6:54:47	great toggle but it is currently not functional we're going to implement the	-
6:54:51	functionality soon enough after we're done with the layout for our product now	-
6:54:56	we can go below this P tag and below this div and there we can add a button	-
6:55:02	this button is going to have a type is equal to button it's also going to have	-
6:55:08	a class name equal to remove dash item and on click for now is going to be	-
6:55:15	empty but later on we're going to remove the item with this button click so	-
6:55:20	inside of there we simply want to show a TI delete outline now if we save this	-
6:55:28	you can notice this delete icon right here and this is looking great let's try	-
6:55:33	adding a few more items to the cart so if we go to these headphones	-
6:55:38	add to cart there we go we now have two different	-
6:55:42	products let's also add the speakers let's try adding five of them and as you	-
6:55:48	can see this is working great but we don't yet have the subtotal nor the	-
6:55:54	quantities for these items so that's going to be another piece of	-
6:55:58	functionality that we'll have to add but before we do that let's add the subtotal	-
6:56:03	for our cart so we're going to go below these three	-
6:56:08	parentheses and then below one more div right here and there we need to check if	-
6:56:14	cart items dot length is greater than or equal to 1. in that	-
6:56:20	case we can render our subtotal div so that's going to be a div that's going	-
6:56:26	to have a class name equal to cart Dash bottom there we can create a new div	-
6:56:34	element it's going to have a class name equal to	
6:56:38	total and inside of there we can render an H3	
6:56:43	element and that H3 is going to Simply say sub total like this	-
6:56:49	and we can render another H3 that's going to render the dollar sign and then	-
6:56:54	the actual total price there we go currently it is not a number	-
6:57:00	but if we go to state context we can set it to zero at the start and once we add	-
6:57:07	something you can notice that now it is 56. so this is working properly the last	-
6:57:14	thing we're going to do is below this inner div we're going to add one more	-
6:57:18	div and this div is going to have a class name equal to BTN Dash container	-
6:57:26	inside of there we're going to have a button component and that button is	-
6:57:31	going to have a type equal to button a class name equal to BTN and for now the	-
6:57:38	on click is going to be set to an empty string because we're going to implement	-
6:57:43	it soon enough as soon as we're done with updating all of the properties	-
6:57:47	quantities for all of our products inside of that button we can simply say	-
6:57:53	pay with stripe and as you can see we're getting much closer with that actual	-
6:57:59	functionality of connecting the stripe Fame and Gateway with our Ecommerce	-
6:58:04	application so that we can process real payments and actually sell our products	-
6:58:09	right but as I promised let's first focus on implementing the quantity	-
6:58:14	updates not only for our product Details page but also for our cart items where	-
6:58:22	we can have multiple items in the cart at the same time	-
6:58:27	to do that we're going to go back into our state context so let's go back here	-
6:58:34	and below are on ADD we're going to create a new function	-
6:58:38	const toggle cart item quantity so we're really trying to be descriptive here	-
6:58:45	that function is going to accept the ID and the value of the product we're	-
6:58:51	trying to work with so first of all we have to find the	-
6:58:56	product we are working with we are updating	
6:59:00	so this is not going to be stored in the state rather it is going to be a special	-
6:59:05	variable or rather should I say just a normal variable that we're going to have	-
6:59:10	access to throughout the state context file so I can say let	-
6:59:15	found product so this is going to be the product that we want to update and we're	-
6:59:20	going to also have the index of the property we want to update so these are	-
6:59:25	two normal variables inside of our functional component	-
6:59:29	we can go back here and then we're going to update that found product so we can	-
6:59:34	say found product is equal to cart items so we want to go through all the card	-
6:59:41	items and find one individual card item so we can say card items dot find	-
6:59:49	item and then if item dot underscore ID is	
6:59:53	equal to product dot underscore ID only then do we know that we really found the	-
7:00:00	product that we want to update to find our product we're going to Loop over the	-
7:00:05	card items by saying card items dot find we need to find something inside of it	-
7:00:10	more specifically we need to find the item like this where the item dot	-
7:00:17	underscore ID is equal to the ID of the item we're trying to update and which	-
7:00:23	we're passing through props once we have found our item we also need	-
7:00:28	to find the index of that item so we can say index is equal to cart items dot	-
7:00:35	find index and there we're going to get a product where the product dot	-
7:00:40	underscore ID is triple equal to ID great so this is going to give us an	-
7:00:46	index of that item in the card items array	
7:00:50	now that we know these properties we need to know are we incrementing or are	-
7:00:55	we decrementing quantity so we can say if	
7:00:58	value is equal to Ink increment this is going	
7:01:03	to be a string that's going to be either decrement or increment and based on that	-
7:01:08	we're going to know what to do so if value is increment we're going to	-
7:01:12	also have an else if so else if value is equal to deck or decrement	-
7:01:19	there we go so if the value is increment we can simply say found product	-
7:01:26	and then dot quantity plus equal to 1. we simply want to	-
7:01:31	update it right then we want to access the cart items	-
7:01:36	and then we want to access a specific index of these cart items and update	-
7:01:43	that with the found product right here but take your time for a second	-
7:01:49	think about the most basic rule of react is this really the best way to approach	-
7:01:57	this problem what is cart items	-
7:02:02	it is an array right but it is also an array that is a state property	-
7:02:10	and what is the most important rule in react	
7:02:14	it is to never mutate the state and that means that you should never update the	-
7:02:20	state with an equal sign like this we should always use the setter function	-
7:02:25	like Set Card items to update the state that way so with this you would actually	-
7:02:32	break rules of react and your code would start behaving unexpectedly	-
7:02:37	so what we can do is we can create a new instance of our card items so let's do	-
7:02:43	something like let new cart items	-
7:02:48	and to do that we're going to create a new array and we're going to spread our	-
7:02:52	current cart items so right here cart items but now we want to add that new	-
7:02:59	product inside of it so what we can do is add a new product which is	-
7:03:04	essentially going to be just an object we want to spread all of the properties	-
7:03:09	of that object right here and then we want to update the quantity of that	-
7:03:15	object to be product dot quantity not context rather quantity but this	-
7:03:22	time plus one because we are incrementing it so what we can do is we	-
7:03:28	can remove this and remove this just keep these new cart items and now we can	-
7:03:34	set card items to be the new cart items or even simpler we can just take this	-
7:03:40	entire thing and immediately set them right here so we are updating the card	-
7:03:45	items with the current card items and we're adding one new element to it we're	-
7:03:51	spreading the properties of that product and we are increasing the quantity by	-
7:03:55	one this is the proper way it should be done in react next thing is that we have	-
7:04:01	to set the total price because that changed so we can say total price we're	-
7:04:06	gonna get the previous total price by using a callback function so prev total	-
7:04:12	price is going to be prev total price and then plus the found product dot	-
7:04:19	price and in this case I think I've made a mistake we want to work with the found	-
7:04:25	product right here so we can simply update the product right here with found	-
7:04:30	product and found product right here because this is the exact product that	-
7:04:35	we are trying to update great and finally we also want to increase the	-
7:04:41	number of total quantities so that's going to be set total quantities to prev	-
7:04:47	Total quantities and then we want to call that prep total	-
7:04:52	quantities and simply say plus one because we just added a new item	-
7:04:57	now for the decrement it's going to be incredibly similar so essentially we can	-
7:05:02	just copy all of the functions right here paste them below first we need to	-
7:05:07	add an if statement and we need to check if found product dot quantity is greater	-
7:05:15	than one because that is the only case where we can actually update it if it's	-
7:05:20	one we cannot lower the quantity because we would go to zero and that's actually	-
7:05:24	what this button does removes the product	
7:05:27	so in this case we're simply going to set the quantity to -1 set the price to	-
7:05:35	the previous total price minus the new price and set the total quantities to	-
7:05:40	previous total quantities minus 1. I know that this function might have been	-
7:05:44	just a bit complicated but just bear with me if you find this whole logic of	-
7:05:50	this Ecommerce store a bit too complicated there's going to be a code	-
7:05:54	for the entire State context so feel free to copy and paste it that way for	-
7:06:00	sure we won't have any errors and you can just keep watching the video to	-
7:06:04	learn it and absorb it I'm sure it's going to make sense really soon so now	-
7:06:09	we want to pass the toggle cart item quantity and we can actually make use of	-
7:06:14	it inside of the cart so inside of our cart we can now get	-
7:06:20	that item or get that function from the state context toggle cart item quantity	-
7:06:26	of course we have to add a comma right here and what we can do is go back to	-
7:06:32	our increment and decrement and now for the on click	-
7:06:37	if I space this out properly we can add a callback function right	-
7:06:42	here we can call the toggle cart item quantity we can pass the item dot	-
7:06:49	underscore ID and the value here is going to be decrement there we go of	-
7:06:55	course this is supposed to be inside of the function call	-
7:07:00	through the second parameter we can also duplicate this on click and paste it for	-
7:07:05	the increment right here but we're just going to change this to Ink as an	-
7:07:11	increment and finally right here we're going to have the item dot quantity so	-
7:07:17	as you can see now we have one speaker and one pair of headphones and we can	-
7:07:22	click here and as you can see we're adding new items and this is not good	-
7:07:27	this is exactly what we were trying to avoid	
7:07:31	so we have to see where is the error in our code and why are new items being	-
7:07:37	added so let's focus on that right away if we go back to our state context we	-
7:07:44	might get a clue on why this is happening if you look at our Set Card	-
7:07:49	items function you can notice that we have an array of all of our current card	-
7:07:54	items and then we are pending a new product to it so we're essentially just	-
7:08:00	adding these items and that is not the correct way to go about it we should	-
7:08:05	actually just update the current card item product that we are trying to	-
7:08:10	update the currency for and not add new products to the cart well since we're	-
7:08:15	adding the updated item right here it would only make sense to first delete	-
7:08:20	the older not yet updated item and we can do that by using the splice	-
7:08:27	method and then splicing a specific index	
7:08:31	so we can say const new cart items and that would be equal to cart items dot	-
7:08:39	splice and then we want to splice from the index to one so we want to splice	-
7:08:46	only one element starting from this Index right here this is going to remove	-
7:08:52	that item and then instead of spreading the cart items we simply want to spread	-
7:08:57	the new cart items which doesn't include the product we are updating right now	-
7:09:03	and we can actually pull this to the top so that we can use it right here as well	-
7:09:09	when we decrement the items great now let's go back reload the page since we	-
7:09:16	don't have local storage our cart is now going to be empty let's add our	-
7:09:21	headphones let's also add our speaker and let's	
7:09:25	open up the cart as you can see everything looks great	-
7:09:29	the subtotal is being accounted for and let's try to increment the headphones	-
7:09:34	okay this is a bit closer but now it over wrote the last item so this is	-
7:09:41	really interesting as we keep doing it something is still breaking and I wanted	-
7:09:46	to include this part in the video because working with e-commerce is not	-
7:09:50	easy there are a lot of things you have to account for managing different items	-
7:09:55	products updating each individual quantity and so many more things can	-
7:10:01	cause so many more bugs so I'm going to lead you through the bug problem solving	-
7:10:06	together that's exactly what the whole point of this is to teach you how to	-
7:10:11	approach and solve problems and this is actually the most important	-
7:10:16	gotcha in react even though we thought that we are no longer mutating the state	-
7:10:22	ourselves we technically are we're calling a DOT splice method on the cart	-
7:10:28	items and a splice method is a mutated method which means that it actually	-
7:10:34	updates the state so it would be better to use a non-mutated method like a	-
7:10:40	filter this is going to give us a proper update of the card items without	-
7:10:45	mutating the state directly so we want to filter out the cart items	-
7:10:50	to include all of the items right here so we can say item but only not include	-
7:10:57	the one that has the index equal to the index we're looking for	-
7:11:03	so we want to use the filter to keep all of the items besides the one we're	-
7:11:08	currently updating and that's going to be easy we're going to get our item and	-
7:11:13	we can say item dot underscore ID is not equal to ID which we passed right here	-
7:11:19	so this is going to make sure to keep all of the other ones where the ID is	-
7:11:24	not equal to ID but only filter out the one where it is and now with this we	-
7:11:30	have new card items right here and here we're not mutating the original state	-
7:11:34	and we should be able to reload our page and see if this is going to work	-
7:11:39	let's add our headphones and our speaker go to the cart and click here okay	-
7:11:46	that's good you can see the speaker updated	
7:11:50	two three four it is working perfectly	-
7:11:55	looking great but as you can see the order of the element changes	-
7:12:01	the last one we click on updates to the bottom of the list	-
7:12:06	this is definitely an interesting problem to tackle I don't really mind it	-
7:12:11	this much at the moment but if you'd like to fix this I urge you to do so	-
7:12:16	this is a great opportunity for you to learn and potentially do some open	-
7:12:20	source work so if you manage to find a solution feel free to go to the GitHub	-
7:12:25	repository of this project and then make a pull request with your fix I will	-
7:12:31	gladly accept it as soon as you do that with that said we are now properly	-
7:12:36	updating the quantities of all of our items in the cart the last thing we have	-
7:12:41	to do is implement the remove functionality	
7:12:46	on remove is also going to be in our state context just above the toggle card	-
7:12:51	item quantity const on remove is equal to a function where we get the product	-
7:12:58	as a parameter we're going to pass that later on	-
7:13:02	and there we also have to do the same thing we have to know which product are	-
7:13:07	we currently updating so we're going to update the found product variable	-
7:13:11	and then we're going to do the same thing as we've done before we're going	-
7:13:14	to copy the cart items to create a version of the new card items without	-
7:13:19	the card item we're currently updating exactly the same thing	-
7:13:24	finally we can call the set total price to be equal to we get the previous total	-
7:13:32	price right here we take that previous total price and we decrement that with	-
7:13:39	found product dot price and we multiply that by the	-
7:13:44	found product dot quantity because we have to know how many products were	-
7:13:48	there of that specific type so if you remove the item speaker 56 we have to	-
7:13:54	multiply that by 5 to get the total actual amount	-
7:13:58	then we also need to update the total quantities currently we have eight items	-
7:14:04	in our list but if we remove this one that's actually going to remove five	-
7:14:09	items so let's create a callback function where we get the current pref	-
7:14:13	total quantities and then we take that number and then we	-
7:14:17	decrement it by found product dot quantity	
7:14:22	and the last thing we want to do is set cart items to be equal to new cart items	-
7:14:30	to update it now if you remove this element you can see that we get Funk	-
7:14:35	that apply is not a function and of course that makes sense that's because	-
7:14:39	we are yet to pass our honorary move to our value right here and then we have to	-
7:14:45	go to our cart we have to take it from our context and	-
7:14:50	then we have to find our delete outline icon and simply add the on remove but we	-
7:14:57	have to call it as a callback function and right there we have to provide the	-
7:15:03	item as the product we want to delete now just before we save that let's make	-
7:15:09	sure we've done everything correctly on remove pass the item we go back to State	-
7:15:14	context to the on remove function right here and	
7:15:19	it looks like our product is not being used here so we have to make use of it	-
7:15:23	we're just going to compare it right here we don't have access to the	-
7:15:27	individual ID we need to do product dot underscore ID and the same thing goes	-
7:15:33	for here product dot underscore ID now if we save this and click right here you	-
7:15:41	can see that it got deleted and our card is now empty everything is functioning	-
7:15:47	as it should we can update the quantity we can remove it and as you can see all	-
7:15:52	of the changes are happening globally across our entire application because	-
7:15:57	states are shared using this great context we can update it we can remove	-
7:16:02	the items we can do whatever we want and all of the changes are reflected	-
7:16:07	everywhere let's go through the entire application workflow one more time to	-
7:16:12	check it out before we start implementing the payments functionality	-
7:16:16	let's go to the speakers and let's go ahead and add to cart great let's move	-
7:16:22	to these cool in-ear headphones and let's add four	-
7:16:27	let's say we really like them we can also go to these headphones	-
7:16:32	and let's add one pair there we go and now we have six items in the cart	-
7:16:38	everything is here let's say that one of her friends doesn't want these	-
7:16:42	headphones so we're just gonna decrease that to three and we can also remove the	-
7:16:47	speaker let's say that we don't need it if we have two pairs of headphones	-
7:16:51	everything is working nicely we are left with one of these three of these four	-
7:16:57	items in total and that subtotals to 175 and we are ready to pay with stripe	-
7:17:05	that is great so finally we can start with these stripe payments functionality	-
7:17:12	this is going to be another big part of this video so take a bit of a break if	-
7:17:18	you need to like this video subscribe let me know in the comments what do you	-
7:17:22	think so far I'm really excited to implement these stripe payments	-
7:17:26	functionality so going back to the code we can close all of our currently open	-
7:17:31	files and folders keep the working environment clean and the next step	-
7:17:36	we're going to focus on is going to be implementing stripe so I hope you're	-
7:17:42	excited to start integrating stripe we can go to our e-commerce folder and then	-
7:17:49	we can go inside of pages and now this is a really special thing	-
7:17:54	with nexgs we have a special API folder this API folder essentially serves the	-
7:18:03	entire backend of our application the part that's written inside of the API is	-
7:18:08	going to be our server and that's not going to be rendered on the front end so	-
7:18:14	inside of a next.js app we don't have a need for a special node and express	-
7:18:19	server we can do everything inside of this API folder so right inside of this	-
7:18:25	API folder we're going to create a new file called stripe dot Js	-
7:18:31	inside of here we can import stripe with a capital letter from stripe we have	-
7:18:38	that installed as a dependency now we have to create a new instance of	-
7:18:44	stripe by saying con stripe is equal to new stripe like this but if we hover	-
7:18:51	over it we might get some more information as you can see the first	-
7:18:55	thing that we need is going to be the API key and we don't already have one so	-
7:19:02	how can we get it well let's go to stripe.com as you can see right here	-
7:19:09	they have in my personal opinion one of the cleanest landing pages of all the	-
7:19:15	websites on the internet it is simple clean and I just love it but let's start	-
7:19:22	with integrating stripe to our new e-commerce store we can go ahead and	-
7:19:27	sign in and if you don't already have the account you can sign up right here	-
7:19:32	by clicking this link and create your new stripe account in my case I'm gonna	-
7:19:38	sign in and as soon as you sign in you can't turn on the test mode right here	-
7:19:44	and then you're gonna get your publishable key and also secret key	-
7:19:48	right here for the test mode so if you want to work with real transactions	-
7:19:53	you'll just have to switch this test mode to false in this case I'm going to	-
7:19:58	take my publishable key and we need to use it right here but to keep it secure	-
7:20:03	I'm going to go inside of my DOT EnV and right here I'm gonna say next underscore	-
7:20:10	public underscore stripe	
7:20:13	underscore publishable underscore key and that is going to be	-
7:20:18	equal to this key right here I'm going to also copy my secret key	-
7:20:24	there we go and I'm gonna Define that as next underscore public underscore stripe	-
7:20:31	underscore secret and finally underscore key and I can paste it right here so now	-
7:20:39	we have all that we need we can go back into our stripe.js and we can pass that	-
7:20:45	API key straight in so right here we can now pass in the	-
7:20:50	process.env dot next underscore public underscore stripe underscore secret	-
7:20:57	underscore key there we go and in next year's each file has to have its own	-
7:21:03	Handler so we can say export default async function Handler and there we have	-
7:21:11	the request and the response the same as we do in Express for example	-
7:21:17	that's going to be a function and the way they've done it you can create a new	-
7:21:23	if statement for each different type of the request so we can say if reg dot	-
7:21:28	method is triple equal to a string of post then	
7:21:33	in here we are handling the post request to forward slash stripe because the file	-
7:21:40	is called stripe.js so that is same old file based routing in practice but this	-
7:21:46	time for backend so what do we actually have to do to make this work well first	-
7:21:53	we're going to have a try and catch block because we need to know what	-
7:21:58	happens if something goes right or if something goes wrong well if something	-
7:22:02	goes wrong we can immediately return res dot status 500 which means a server	-
7:22:07	error and then dot Json we're going to send back an object where the status	-
7:22:12	code is going to be set to 500 and message is going to be equal to error	-
7:22:19	Dot message there we go now of course we're concerned with what happens if	-
7:22:24	everything goes right how do we actually process the payment well I would	-
7:22:30	strongly recommend that you read stripe documentation they have phenomenal docs	-
7:22:35	and essentially you can learn how to do anything with their services in this	-
7:22:40	case we want to accept online payments so just go here and as you can see we	-
7:22:45	can Implement a pre-built checkout page or a custom payment flow in this case	-
7:22:50	we're going to go with pre-built checkout page and right here you can see	-
7:22:54	how to handle that they even simplify it to the point where you can just choose	-
7:22:59	your front-end framework like nexgs and based on that they hide all of the other	-
7:23:04	backend programming languages and assume that they're gonna do everything in	-
7:23:08	next.js so as you can see we have our entire file right here	-
7:23:14	what I would do to be completely honest is just copy this entire part right here	-
7:23:19	so let's go ahead and do that we're going to paste it over what we currently	-
7:23:23	have and it's going to be fairly similar instead of import the use required here	-
7:23:28	and they immediately pass that process.env but in our case that's not	-
7:23:34	stripe secret key as they called it you can see they called it next public	-
7:23:39	strike publishable key and stripe secret key so they're not actually pushing this	-
7:23:44	to the web we can copy that and if we go to our process.env or just EnV we can	-
7:23:51	simply enter the stripe secret key and now we should be good to go so we are	-
7:23:56	really following their steps there we go now let's explore the code	-
7:24:01	create checkout sessions from body params so inside of here we have some	-
7:24:07	kind of line items which is an array with different objects where we can	-
7:24:12	specify the quantity and price this is exactly what we want to do but we just	-
7:24:19	have to know which parameters do we want to pass so what I'm going to do now is	-
7:24:24	I'm going to take this object from here and I'm going to call that params and	-
7:24:29	declare it above const params is equal to and then we pulled everything out and	-
7:24:36	now we can simply pass it back in I'm going to expand this code a bit because	-
7:24:40	we're going to be focusing more on the logic now there we go and now our goal	-
7:24:45	is to figure out how to understand which products have the users selected in the	-
7:24:51	application then we have to bring them here and use them as list items first of	-
7:24:57	all there are gonna be some additional properties that we need to pass through	-
7:25:00	params things such as submit underscore type is going to be equal to pay we want	-
7:25:07	to pay something the mode is going to be set to payment	-
7:25:12	then we're going to have the payment underscore method underscore types which	-
7:25:18	is also going to be set to Simply card we have the billing underscore address	-
7:25:23	underscore collection which is going to be set to Auto these are some some	-
7:25:29	additional props that I found to work best with simple purchases such as this	-
7:25:34	one we can also provide shipping options	
7:25:37	this is a really cool thing that I'm going to teach you how to do from	-
7:25:41	scratch so you can create an array of shipping options and each shipping	-
7:25:47	option is going to be a new object that is going to have its own shipping rate	-
7:25:53	but the key thing happens now since you have to create this new shipping rate	-
7:25:58	inside of stripe so let's go back to our stripe Commerce and let's go to products	-
7:26:05	under products we have shipping rates let's create our first shipping rate	-
7:26:11	let's say that the amount is going to be completely free	-
7:26:14	so we're gonna say free shipping and we don't need to specify the	-
7:26:20	business days and simply save it as you can see we have our free shipping	-
7:26:25	and we get the ID of that shipping so we can simply copy it right here and paste	-
7:26:31	it right here and let's add an additional shipping rate	-
7:26:35	for example new that's going to be let's do in USD that's going to be 20 bucks	-
7:26:41	and we're going to say fast shipping so a user can select and this is going	-
7:26:47	to be between one to three business days let's save it we can again copy that ID	-
7:26:53	and we can paste it right here under the second shipping option but now we are at	-
7:27:00	the main point and that is how can we get the list items from our application	-
7:27:05	how are we going to know what has the user added to the cart well once the	-
7:27:11	user clicks this pay with strike button then we have to pass that data to our	-
7:27:16	next JS backend let's do that right away we already know that that button right	-
7:27:23	here is under product Slug and then we have the buy now button but that's not	-
7:27:31	the same button that is this button right here let's first deal with the one	-
7:27:35	that's inside of the cart so I'm gonna go to our components and then cart.jsx	-
7:27:42	there we have the pay with stripe button that bay with strike button is going to	-
7:27:48	call a special function called handle check out	-
7:27:53	and we can Define it right here at the top cons handle checkout	-
7:27:58	is going to be a basic react Arrow function now let's see if stripe docs	-
7:28:04	talk about this special checkout function	
7:28:07	we are now looking at the pages index.js and let's see we have the use effect	-
7:28:14	right here do we have the purchase button we do this button is going to	-
7:28:20	trigger post method on the API checkout so we have to do something similar to	-
7:28:25	this but they don't really explain it in a way that we would like so what we can	-
7:28:30	do is go back to our code and I'm going to explain everything for you sometimes	-
7:28:36	you have to go around the docs a bit and see what works for you so first of all	-
7:28:40	we'll have to get an instance of a stripe promise	-
7:28:44	to do that we can create a new file inside of the lib folder and we're going	-
7:28:50	to call it get stripe dot JS inside of our get stripe we can import load stripe	-
7:28:57	and that's going to be coming from add stripe forward slash stripe Dash JS then	-
7:29:05	we can declare an empty stripe promise this is a variable that's going to be	-
7:29:10	undefined at the start but then we're going to create a function const get	-
7:29:15	stripe and that is going to be equal to an arrow function inside of there we're	-
7:29:19	gonna check if the stripe promise doesn't yet exist then we want to set	-
7:29:26	the stripe promise to be equal to load stripe function and then we call it to	-
7:29:32	it we can provide the process.env dot next underscore public	-
7:29:38	like this underscore stripe underscore publishable	
7:29:43	underscore key there we go and finally we're going to return this tribe promise	-
7:29:50	there we go of course we have to export default R function so get stripe now we	-
7:29:59	can go back to our cart and we can actually use that function so right here	-
7:30:04	we can import that's going to be get stripe	-
7:30:08	from dot slash lib forward slash get stripe there we go now what we can do	-
7:30:15	inside of the handle checkout we can say can't stripe to get that specific	-
7:30:20	instance of stripe is equal to a weight get stripe and we call it as a function	-
7:30:27	now we're going to make an API request to our own nexjs backend that is kind of	-
7:30:34	crazy it's really cool that nextgs allowed us to create both a front end	-
7:30:38	and a back-end application in one package	
7:30:41	so we can see const response is equal to	-
7:30:45	a weight we're going to use just a basic fetch	-
7:30:49	although feel free to use axios right here and the first parameter is the API	-
7:30:54	route so that's going to be four slash API and then forward slash stripe	-
7:30:59	because we are under Pages API and then Stripe Right here then the second	-
7:31:05	parameter is going to be an object that's going to contain all the options	-
7:31:11	so we can say the method is going to be post	
7:31:14	and we already know this because inside of Stripe Right Here we said that the	-
7:31:19	method has to be posed on the stripe endpoint then we're going to also	-
7:31:24	provide headers sometimes this is not necessary but it's always better to do	-
7:31:28	so content type is going to be set to application forward slash Json and	-
7:31:35	finally the last and most important thing is to pass in the body which is	-
7:31:40	going to be json.stringify so we're going to stringify the data and we want	-
7:31:45	to pass in cart items there we go so we're passing all of our products which	-
7:31:51	are contained inside of card items what we can do is say if response that status	-
7:31:57	code is equal to 500 then we know that something went wrong so we can simply	-
7:32:03	exit this function if that is not the case that must mean	-
7:32:08	that we're gonna get the data and that data is going to be equal to a weight	-
7:32:13	response dot Json if we have the data we can say toast dot loading and we can say	-
7:32:20	redirecting because we will be redirecting to the	
7:32:24	checkout and finally we can call that stripe instance and say stripe dot	-
7:32:30	redirect to check out they really made this easy	
7:32:35	and we can provide the session ID which is going to be equal to data dot	-
7:32:41	ID so we essentially created one instance of a checkout this specific	-
7:32:46	user is going to be on that specific instance and it's going to be kept in	-
7:32:50	the back end even after they're gone so if they want to return and continue with	-
7:32:54	the purchase they'll be able to do so and that's it so now we are actually	-
7:33:00	making a request to our backend we are accepting it and we're sending in the	-
7:33:06	body with our request so we should be able to get all the products right here	-
7:33:12	if we consolag that's going to be Rec Dodge body dot cart items let's see if	-
7:33:20	that is really the case I'm going to go back to our application	-
7:33:24	and I'll try to click pay with stripe and I'm going to open up the console	-
7:33:30	there we go so I'm gonna put it right here pay it	-
7:33:34	with stripe and we immediately get function.apply is not a function let me	-
7:33:39	just quickly reload the page since we've added many changes	-
7:33:43	there we go we can already see that something is not working and this means	-
7:33:47	that I forgot to add the async keyword to our handle checkout function it's	-
7:33:54	calling a weight a few times here so it definitely needs to be asynchronous	-
7:33:59	there we go let's reload let's add headphones to our cart and let's pay	-
7:34:05	with stripe okay nothing seemed to happen	
7:34:08	but that's fine let's see if we got a console log	-
7:34:12	an interesting thing about this is since this is a real back end we won't be	-
7:34:16	seeing a console log right here in the console of the browser's inspect element	-
7:34:21	there is nothing here besides just a few warnings the console logs will be	-
7:34:27	showing up in our terminal so as you can see right here if I Collapse this we	-
7:34:33	should be able to get there we go all of our products in this	-
7:34:38	case that is just one product you can see we have a few images and it is a	-
7:34:43	second pair of headphones that means that we can actually use reg.body.cart	-
7:34:48	items to populate these items right here and form our final stripe checkout so	-
7:34:55	what we can do is instead of this static array right here we can Loop through our	-
7:35:01	rec.body DOT cart items and we can call a DOT map method on it get each item and	-
7:35:09	then create a function block we can add a comma at the end of course the reason	-
7:35:14	why we're doing this is because we have to modify each specific item to provide	-
7:35:19	some additional information like the price quantity and the image first of	-
7:35:24	all there's going to be some gotchas with the images we can say const IMG is	-
7:35:29	equal to item dot image 0 and then dot acid dot underscore ref if we look at	-
7:35:37	our terminal you can see that we have our images we get the first image and	-
7:35:43	then we have to go under asset and then there's going to be a reference right	-
7:35:47	there but this reference is just that a reference to the image that's deployed	-
7:35:52	on sanity it's not a real image right here so we can do const New Image like	-
7:35:59	this is equal to IMG dot replace that reference is going to contain a string	-
7:36:06	that looks like this image Dash and we want to replace that with the actual URL	-
7:36:12	pointing to our image for that you can write https in a string so https colon	-
7:36:20	forward slash forward slash cdn.sanity dot IO forward slash images	-
7:36:27	forward slash and then we have to enter the ID of our project so that's going to	-
7:36:32	be right here you can copy it go to sanity manage and then find your project	-
7:36:37	I'm gonna paste it right here and then one more time forward slash production	-
7:36:43	and then forward slash finally we also have to replace so dot	-
7:36:48	replace a string of Dash web B with a string dot webp it is possible that	-
7:36:57	you'll have to handle this for other file types as well in this case we are	-
7:37:00	using the web B format it might be a good idea to do jpegs so just slash jpeg	-
7:37:06	or slash PNG turn it into a DOT and this should give us access to that image what	-
7:37:12	we can do is even console log this so let's console log the new image and	-
7:37:18	let's provide a string image and then add a comma right here just to see if	-
7:37:24	we're getting something meaningful so let's go back to our application	-
7:37:27	reload the page let's add to cart open up the console right here and let's	-
7:37:33	click pay with stripe as soon as we did that we got back	-
7:37:38	undefined which is usually not a good thing it would be interesting to see	-
7:37:43	where that came from it couldn't be this and it shouldn't really be this as well	-
7:37:48	so let's just keep going with this and potentially we're gonna get to something	-
7:37:52	meaningful really soon now that we have our image we want to	-
7:37:57	return an object that is going to represent one of our items first we have	-
7:38:03	to set up the price underscore data there has to be a currency of course so	-
7:38:08	we can say currency is going to be equal to USD	-
7:38:12	we have to provide some additional product underscore data	-
7:38:16	and of course that's going to be the name which is going to be item dot name	-
7:38:22	and also images where we're going to provide an array that's going to include	-
7:38:27	just our new image we also have to provide the unit	-
7:38:32	underscore amount and that is going to be item dot price times 100 because the	-
7:38:39	unit amount has to be in cents finally we're going to say adjustable	-
7:38:45	quantity with an underscore in between and we're	
7:38:49	going to set that to an object that's going to say enabled is going to be set	-
7:38:53	to true and a minimum is going to be set to 1. finally the starting quantity	-
7:39:00	is going to be equal to item dot quantity	
7:39:04	there we go so now we've formed each one of our line items great	-
7:39:11	this mode right here which is payment I think we already have it so I can delete	-
7:39:15	it from here and then we have our success URL as well as our cancel URL	-
7:39:21	and for now we can leave these URLs as they are finally once we have all the	-
7:39:27	params we want to say create checkout sessions from body programs there we	-
7:39:32	pass all of these params and then at the end we don't want to redirect we simply	-
7:39:38	want to rest that status 200	
7:39:41	and then dot Json we're going to send back that session that we have right	-
7:39:46	here now let's save this go back to our application	-
7:39:52	add to cart and click pay with stripe as you can see	-
7:39:56	nothing happened yet let's open up the inspect element to see what's happening	-
7:40:01	inside of the console let's start from scratch warning each	-
7:40:06	child in a list should have a key prop this is happening in product details	-
7:40:11	this is just a warning but I always like to fix these small errors so if we go to	-
7:40:17	product more specifically if we go to product	
7:40:20	details that's going to be under slug let's try to search for a map	-
7:40:25	it is right here and yes we are missing a key right here so a key in this case	-
7:40:31	is going to be Index this map has a key and this map right here	-
7:40:38	also doesn't have a key but this is not a jsx element so we should be good to go	-
7:40:43	warning expected on click to be a function but got a value of string that	-
7:40:48	is fine we just put that as a placeholder same thing for this this	-
7:40:53	this and this so it looks like we are actually fully okay	-
7:40:58	if we click here though we get two errors localhost 3000 API stripe 500.	-
7:41:05	that means that we are going to our stripe and we are being hit with a 500	-
7:41:12	right here which means that something is going wrong unexpected token C in Json	-
7:41:19	at position zero we have to debug this together let's go back to our cart one	-
7:41:26	more time to see if you're properly making that API request we create a new	-
7:41:31	instance of stripe or rather get the existing one then we create a response	-
7:41:36	that's going to go to forward slash API forward slash stripe we set the method	-
7:41:41	to be post the headers to content type application Json and then we send back	-
7:41:46	the json.stringify cart items if the response is 500 then we go outside of	-
7:41:53	the function if the response is not 500 we get back the data a weight	-
7:41:59	response.json we loaded and then we redirected the checkout where we set the	-
7:42:04	session ID to be equal to that data ID that we returned all of this is looking	-
7:42:11	good to me so a problem must be somewhere inside of our stripe back end	-
7:42:16	even though stripe docs suggest that the user require here I think we're good to	-
7:42:21	go with using a regular import statement so we can say import Stripe from stripe	-
7:42:29	there we go and then we can say constripe is equal to	-
7:42:34	new stripe like this and then we provide dot stripe secret key	-
7:42:41	in this case I was always used to writing next underscore public	-
7:42:45	underscore stripe secret key so let's go back to our process.env	-
7:42:51	and right here rename this to next public stripe secret key now if we go	-
7:42:56	there we can use this process cnv variable there we go whenever you change	-
7:43:02	variables it is always advisable to Simply re-run your development	-
7:43:06	environment there we go so we have our Handler we get our cart	-
7:43:11	items right here we create our params and then we simply return the session	-
7:43:17	this looks good to me let's reload one more time	-
7:43:22	let's add to cart open the cart and click pay with stripe	-
7:43:27	the same error is happening one more time localhost 3000 forward slash API	-
7:43:33	forward slash stripe internal server error if we click right here	-
7:43:39	and right there we should be able to see something at	-
7:43:43	the payload and we can see that we do have a pair of	-
7:43:47	headphones so we were successfully sending them in but we can see an error	-
7:43:52	right here cannot read properties of undefined reading map let's go back to	-
7:43:58	our code let's search for a map	-
7:44:01	and as you can see it cannot read property of undefined reading map	-
7:44:07	this is a weird error but it definitely must do something with our cart items	-
7:44:13	and the way we're mapping over them if we open up the console we can see that	-
7:44:18	card items seem to be undefined although that definitely shouldn't be the case we	-
7:44:25	are passing them right here body and then cart items oh I see the error right	-
7:44:31	here we're passing the card items straight right here as the body we	-
7:44:36	didn't specify an object or We Set Card items are equal to cart items in the	-
7:44:42	body so we're immediately referencing to that so if we go back to our backend	-
7:44:47	endpoint the card items are going to be straight inside of the rec.body	-
7:44:52	there we go so right here rec.body.map should be fine in our case	-
7:44:58	let's retry the request there we go looks like we got another	-
7:45:04	error but this time it is a 400 bad request let's open the new one received	-
7:45:10	unknown parameter line item 0 adjustable quantity	
7:45:15	minimum did you mean minimum yes I misspelled it so stripe really gave us a	-
7:45:22	meaningful error right here this is going to be minimum there we go	-
7:45:27	let's try to retry it one more time pay it with stripe	-
7:45:31	and another 400 the currency of your line items USD must match with your	-
7:45:38	currency of your shipping rate and the shipping rate is in Euros so this is	-
7:45:43	really cool stripe is really making sure that we do everything correctly so I'm	-
7:45:48	going to go back to my shipping rates and I'll see if I can edit them it looks	-
7:45:53	like I cannot edit them right away so what I'm gonna do in my case I'm simply	-
7:45:58	going to switch this to euros but you can keep it in USD if this worked for	-
7:46:02	you so I'm gonna go back right here reload this and pay with stripe	-
7:46:10	another 400 the currency of your item line Euro must match with the currency	-
7:46:15	of your shipping rate which is in USD so it seems that it is the other way around	-
7:46:20	now I'm gonna bring this back to USD and I'll try to create two new shipping	-
7:46:26	rates so let's simply go to shipping rates	
7:46:31	I'm gonna add a new one and that is going to be in USD as well let's do	-
7:46:37	something like zero again just free shipping and let's click save	-
7:46:43	so now we know that this is in USD and I'm going to copy the ID right here and	-
7:46:49	let's say that we only have one shipping rate which is going to be free I'm just	-
7:46:53	going to paste it right here let's save that and let's test it one	-
7:46:58	more time pay with stripe	-
7:47:01	and we got a 200 and we were redirected to our checkout would you look at this	-
7:47:08	we have our special JavaScript Mastery checkout which is currently in test mode	-
7:47:13	we can modify the quantity right here we have the price of our headphones the	-
7:47:18	subtotal the free shipping and the total amount and right here we have a	-
7:47:24	beautiful checkout which is powered by stripe and it allows us to enter all of	-
7:47:28	our information let's give it a go so right here I'm gonna enter my email I'm	-
7:47:34	gonna do JavaScript Mastery zero zero at gmail.com	
7:47:39	card information for stripe you have a fake demo card which is four two four	-
7:47:44	two and then just keep repeating four two until you come to the end you can	-
7:47:49	just enter four two four two for the date and same thing goes for the CV the	-
7:47:55	name can be something like JavaScript Mastery and you can also choose your	-
7:48:00	region and let's click pay and we have a successful order and we will return back	-
7:48:08	to our home page this means that we have successfully carried out our first	-
7:48:13	transaction of course this was just a test payment but with stripe it should	-
7:48:18	be fairly easy to bring this to real payments as well let's go back to our	-
7:48:23	shipping rates if we go to our payments and under our payments in our stripe	-
7:48:28	dashboard we can see a 55 bucks succeeded payment we can even open it up	-
7:48:34	to see more information about a customer to see the ending of the card they used	-
7:48:39	the checkout summary and everything is here if you were to ship these products	-
7:48:45	you would be able to do that based on this information so this is great	-
7:48:51	amazing job we have actually carried out a complete test payment looking great	-
7:48:58	and if you want to send an email about a successful payment to your paying	-
7:49:03	customer you can go to settings right here scroll down to business settings	-
7:49:08	and then emails email customers about successful payments and that's going to	-
7:49:15	be it just make sure to save it right here it is highly likely that these	-
7:49:20	payments won't be set for test payments but if you turn this on once you	-
7:49:24	actually start accepting real payments they will get an email but just the fact	-
7:49:30	that we can see our succeeded payment right here is enough for me this is	-
7:49:36	looking great now what do you say that we create a great looking payment	-
7:49:42	succeeded page let me show you how this looks like on our finished site we can	-
7:49:47	buy some speakers and headphones and we can pay with stripe in here you can see	-
7:49:52	how it looks like for multiple products we can enter our email and in this case	-
7:49:57	I chose two different shipping methods you can do that as well I showed you how	-
7:50:02	easy it is to create a new shipping method we can enter our fake card data	-
7:50:07	right here there we go and for name I'm going to use JavaScript Mastery and	-
7:50:13	let's use some fake address right here test test let's do zero zero zero zero	-
7:50:18	and the city is going to be test and we can pay it	-
7:50:23	let's not save this and payment succeeded thank you for your purchase	-
7:50:29	with a lot of confetti right here so let's implement this new successful page	-
7:50:35	right away that's going to be our next task let's go back to our own page	-
7:50:41	and let's simply collapse it right here to do that we can create a new page	-
7:50:47	inside of the pages folder so let's right click click new file and let's	-
7:50:53	call it success.js inside of here we can also	-
7:50:58	run rafce we're going to call this success	-
7:51:03	and let's first import all of the components that we're gonna have to use	-
7:51:07	let's fix the typos first of course success with double c and double s we	-
7:51:12	want to import react use State and use effect hooks	-
7:51:19	we also need to import the link component which is coming from next	-
7:51:24	forward slash link we're going to also import an icon called BS bag check	-
7:51:31	fill and that is coming from react Dash icons forward slash BS	-
7:51:38	we're gonna also have to use the use router hook which is coming from next	-
7:51:43	forward slash router finally we're gonna also use the state context here so we	-
7:51:49	can say use State context and that is coming from dot slash context forward	-
7:51:56	slash state context that's all that we need so first things	-
7:52:02	first in here we can immediately get some properties from our state context	-
7:52:07	We Are Gonna Get Set Card items we need this because we'll reset the card items	-
7:52:14	to an empty array set total price we're gonna also reset	-
7:52:18	this to zero and then set total quantities as well	-
7:52:22	like this because that's also going to be reset to zero and we get all of these	-
7:52:28	by using that state context I hope that by now you can notice the	-
7:52:34	advantage that we got by using this specialized context State we can always	-
7:52:40	just tap into it from all of our components and they all share the same	-
7:52:45	state we're going to also create a new state in this component right here so	-
7:52:50	use state we can use the use State snippet and	-
7:52:55	we're going to call it order and set order and at the start it's going to be	-
7:52:59	set to null finally let's create the jsx for our success page	-
7:53:05	we're gonna have a new class name right here	
7:53:09	that class name is going to be success Dash wrapper	-
7:53:14	then inside of there we're gonna have a new div and that div is going to have a	-
7:53:20	class name equal to success inside of there we're going to have a P tag and	-
7:53:26	this B tag is going to have a class name equal to Icon and of course it's going	-
7:53:33	to render the BS bag check fill which is going to be a self-closing icon	-
7:53:39	component we can already go to this page by simply going to success so localhost	-
7:53:46	3000 forward slash success let's try to open it up there we go	-
7:53:53	and success there we go you can see that we have	-
7:53:57	this bag right here then below our P tag we're gonna simply create an H2 inside	-
7:54:05	of this H2 we can say thank you for your order great	-
7:54:11	and now that I think about it we won't even be needing this order right here	-
7:54:16	and we also won't use the use router so we can get rid of those things	-
7:54:21	immediately great below are thank you for your purchase we're gonna have a P	-
7:54:27	tag right here and that b tag is going to have a class name equal to email Dash	-
7:54:35	MSG as in message so we can say check your email inbox for the receipt there	-
7:54:43	we go and below that we're going to add a	-
7:54:47	description to our successful order and that's going to be a P tag that's	-
7:54:53	going to have a class name equal to description	
7:54:56	and there we can say if you have any questions please email and then we can	-
7:55:04	render an anchor tag right here that's going to have a class name equal to	-
7:55:10	email and then href is going to be equal to mail 2 and then you can enter your	-
7:55:16	name right here I'm gonna do orders at example.com and you can simply copy that	-
7:55:22	email address and put it inside of the anchor tag as well now if we save this	-
7:55:28	they'll be able to click here if they have any questions	-
7:55:31	finally below the speed tag we're gonna add a link and that link is going to	-
7:55:37	have an href 2 simply forward slash we want to render a button inside of it	-
7:55:44	and that button is going to have a type equal to button	-
7:55:50	we can give it a fixed width of around 300 pixels	-
7:55:54	and finally we're going to give it a class name equal to BTN and it's simply	-
7:56:00	going to say continue shopping there we go	-
7:56:05	we have our button we have our confirmation everything is here besides	-
7:56:10	one thing we also want to clear all of our states we need to make sure that the	-
7:56:17	previous order is completely done so to do that we're going to use a use	-
7:56:23	effect and as soon as somebody comes to this	
7:56:27	page meaning on load meaning this dependency array is going to be empty	-
7:56:33	that means that this function is going to execute as soon as the successful	-
7:56:37	page is loaded there we want to first of all clear the local storage so local	-
7:56:44	storage.clear this is something that we're going to	
7:56:47	implement later on so far we are not yet saving anything into local storage but	-
7:56:52	just so we don't forget let's clear it here in any case then we're going to	-
7:56:57	also set the cart items to be equal to an empty array we will also set the	-
7:57:04	total price to be set to zero we need to set the total quantities to	-
7:57:11	be zero as well and we get an error as you can see right	-
7:57:16	here because Set Card items doesn't seem to be existent let's see Set Card items	-
7:57:23	this is looking good to me it is possible that we are not passing	-
7:57:28	it though through our context so if we go here and scroll all the way down we	-
7:57:34	need to pass set cart items there we go it looks like	-
7:57:41	we're also not passing the set total price so let's pass the set total price	-
7:57:47	as well and the same thing goes for the set total quantities we're gonna pass	-
7:57:52	that as well great but what do you say that we add that great looking confetti	-
7:57:58	page as well well that confetti is going to be	-
7:58:02	another one of our components well the code for that confetti is going to be in	-
7:58:08	a new file inside of our lib we're going to create a utils file	-
7:58:13	utils.js utils stands for utility functions you call these in a few places	-
7:58:18	in your application you don't want to write a code everywhere you just write	-
7:58:22	it here and then call it from other places so right here we can import	-
7:58:26	confetti from canvas Dash confetti this is a great confetti package that I found	-
7:58:34	online and they provide you with the entirety of the code to achieve that	-
7:58:39	confetti look so let's go to our site and let's simply Google canvas confetti	-
7:58:46	npm if we go here you're gonna notice that they have almost 250 000 weekly	-
7:58:52	downloads and what do we have to do	
7:58:56	if you keep scrolling you can see that you can easily create something but we	-
7:59:01	want to look for some pre-done examples so let's scroll up	-
7:59:05	let's go to demo we have the basic Canon right here we have the random Direction	-
7:59:10	the realistic look as well I really like this one yeah fireworks is	-
7:59:16	going to be good so let's simply copy this fireworks right here	-
7:59:20	let's export const run fireworks like this that's going to be an arrow	-
7:59:27	function there we go and inside of there we can	
7:59:31	pass our code we're just gonna make this about five seconds I think that should	-
7:59:36	be more than enough and all of this code is something you don't have to worry	-
7:59:40	about we just have it here we copied it from their Library	-
7:59:45	so now if we go back to our success page we can simply import the confetti from	-
7:59:52	the top import run fireworks and this will be	-
7:59:58	coming from dot slash lib forward slash utils	
8:00:03	and we can simply call The Run fireworks right here	-
8:00:09	there we go so what do you say that we give it one	-
8:00:13	final go we go through the entirety of our application and see if everything	-
8:00:19	works first of all it looks like we have some	
8:00:23	problems with our confetti so let's go to our utils right here	-
8:00:29	confetti from canvas confetti this is looking good to me let's reload	-
8:00:35	the page and it looks like I misspelled confetti	-
8:00:39	my bad there that's going to be one F and then two T's sorry about that	-
8:00:44	hopefully you got it right so once we have that we should be able	-
8:00:49	to reload the page and we immediately can see that confetti	-
8:00:54	it should stop after about five seconds but as I promised let's give our	-
8:01:00	application one final go so let's say we want to buy some headphones we can click	-
8:01:06	shop now to buy the summer sale headphones right here	-
8:01:10	and we can add them to the cart we're going to also figure out hey we	-
8:01:15	might want to use some cool in-ear headphones as well so let's add two	-
8:01:20	pairs let's go to our cart and let's click pay with stripe	-
8:01:25	it's going to take a second we'll see that redirecting pop-up and we can	-
8:01:29	immediately see our entire checkout with the correct amount	-
8:01:34	let's go ahead and enter our email enter the 424242 as the card information name	-
8:01:41	on card is going to be JavaScript Mastery and we are ready to pay it's	-
8:01:46	processing hopefully we got enough money and we are not redirected to Our Success	-
8:01:52	page that's a bummer right so what we can do is we can see that we	-
8:01:58	are redirected to success is equal to true	
8:02:01	and if you remember correctly stripe had that success URL	-
8:02:07	so actually we have to redirect to just success or just cancel like this	-
8:02:14	without any extra parameters like this	-
8:02:19	I think this is going to work so let's just give it one final go I'll try to be	-
8:02:24	really quick add to cart pay with stripe you can see it looks	-
8:02:29	great on mobile as well we input our demo card we are really	-
8:02:34	going hard on it right we enter our name and we pay it and there we go thank you	-
8:02:41	for your order the success page is right here and we can continue shopping this	-
8:02:48	is looking great if you remember correctly I promise you that we're gonna	-
8:02:52	do a few things and first of these things is to also fix the buy now button	-
8:02:58	as right now it is not working the buy now button is going to be much simpler	-
8:03:04	because instead of adding something to the cart and then going to pay with	-
8:03:08	stripe we're going to make it work immediately just straight to the	-
8:03:12	checkout so that's going to be our next step and we are slowly closing down on	-
8:03:18	this great project a fully functional e-commerce application with complete	-
8:03:23	stripe payment integration and with sanity the platform for structured data	-
8:03:29	looking great stay excited it until the end because we are really nailing this	-
8:03:34	down you're learning quite a lot and even better stuff is coming implementing	-
8:03:39	that buy Now functionality is going to be incredibly easy let's go ahead and	-
8:03:45	collapse this let's go back to our code and what we can do right here is go back	-
8:03:51	to our slug file the product details file we can scroll up and go to our buy	-
8:03:58	now button on click we can call our Handle	
8:04:03	by Now function and that function can be created right here cons Handle by now	-
8:04:12	the only thing we have to do to make this look and function great is called	-
8:04:17	that same on ADD function right here on ADD and we're gonna pass the product we	-
8:04:24	want to buy and the quantity we want to buy and we're also going to set the show	-
8:04:30	cart to be set to true so as soon as we do that we can go back and now if you	-
8:04:37	simply click buy now as you can see we're gonna get an error said show card	-
8:04:41	is not defined and that's happening because we are not getting it right here	-
8:04:46	from the state context so we can say set show cart	-
8:04:52	now we have access to that and if we reload the page	-
8:04:57	and click buy now you can see it adds it and you can immediately complete the	-
8:05:02	purchase so essentially this is incredibly similar to add to cart this	-
8:05:07	one just adds it so you can continue shopping but if you go ahead and click	-
8:05:11	buy now it is immediately going to hide it right there and you can proceed with	-
8:05:16	a purchase with that said You remember how we had some errors before so let's	-
8:05:20	open up the console and see if we still have some we have one right here on	-
8:05:26	click is supposed to be a value but it is a string so let's fix this one right	-
8:05:32	away we can already see that our error is inside of a span element inside of	-
8:05:39	product details so that is our slack component right here but I think we	-
8:05:44	solve this so if I reload the page yep now we only have one error so that's	-
8:05:49	going to be a span inside of product details let's go ahead and find it on	-
8:05:55	click is equal to and then right here so if you click on this specific number	-
8:06:00	there we don't need to have any on click properties just like that	-
8:06:07	and now we have zero errors zero warnings everything is working as it	-
8:06:14	should we can go ahead and inspect it go to the mobile view right here let's do	-
8:06:20	iPhone 12. this is looking good as well everything is mobile responsive let's go	-
8:06:27	to our speaker looking great as well these elements	-
8:06:32	scroll right here at the bottom we can hover over specific elements to get new	-
8:06:37	images we can add it to the cart and the change appears right here so everything	-
8:06:44	is looking great we have our final Ecommerce store of course you can make	-
8:06:52	this completely your own go wild with the Styles now that you know how the	-
8:06:57	functionality Works styling it is easy find a great looking design for an	-
8:07:03	e-commerce store online accommodate it to your own product and go wild but the	-
8:07:09	most important part is that you know how to handle the items using sanity and you	-
8:07:14	know how to handle payments using stripe with that said the last step in our	-
8:07:20	journey is deploying this great store to the web so that you can share it with	-
8:07:25	your friends potential employers and most importantly customers if you're	-
8:07:29	you're planning to bring this store live deploying applications using nexgs is	-
8:07:34	pretty straightforward let me show you how to do it first of all let's close	-
8:07:39	all of our files to have a clean working environment there we go and we can also	-
8:07:44	close all of our currently open pages right here we just need the store and	-
8:07:50	the sanity manage project there we go for deployment with nextgs we're gonna	-
8:07:56	use versel versel combines the best developer experience with an obsessive	-
8:08:01	focus on end user performance so what we can do is just click Start deploying	-
8:08:07	right here and then you can continue with GitHub once you log in you'll be	-
8:08:12	able to import your git repository but of course to get our store live we have	-
8:08:17	to first push it to git and GitHub to do that you can go to GitHub create a new	-
8:08:23	repository let's name it something like e-commerce underscore sanity underscore	-
8:08:29	stripe again feel free to use your own name right here I'm going to make it	-
8:08:33	public just in this case and let's go ahead and create a repository once you	-
8:08:39	have it keep these instructions right here on the side	-
8:08:42	and on the left side we're going to have our code editor	-
8:08:46	so let's open up our terminal Ctrl C and then y	-
8:08:51	and make sure that you are inside of this e-commerce folder	-
8:08:55	let's run git init git add Dot	-
8:09:00	git commit Dash M and then in here we can say first commit let's also change	-
8:09:06	the branch to main let's also do get remote add origin	-
8:09:11	and finally get push you origin master in just a few seconds you can reload	-
8:09:18	your GitHub page and you'll be able to see that all of your code is right here	-
8:09:22	now we can go back to our cell and immediately we have our e-commerce	-
8:09:28	website right here so let's import it right here we can choose a nexjs	-
8:09:34	framework and we can add some environment variables right here we can	-
8:09:39	essentially copy everything we have in our EnV so let's copy the next public	-
8:09:44	sanity token and right here we can copy the actual key let's add it and repeat	-
8:09:49	the process for all other variables next public stripe publishable key as well	-
8:09:56	and the value right here final one is next public stripe secret	-
8:10:01	key and also the value for that as well	
8:10:06	and we are ready to deploy our project so let's click deploy and let's wait	-
8:10:11	about a minute as versel is going to do all the heavy lifting for us and there	-
8:10:16	we go in just a few seconds we can see our website deployed we can click right	-
8:10:21	here and will be re-navigated to our new deployed site this is looking great	-
8:10:27	let's go ahead and test it out let's go to the speaker right here and let's buy	-
8:10:33	it pay with stripe we got redirected to our	
8:10:37	own custom stripe checkout let's try with the fake card one more time	-
8:10:43	again four two four two four two name JavaScript Mastery and pay it's	-
8:10:48	processing and immediately thank you for your order which means that it went	-
8:10:54	through if we open up our stripe dashboard you can see that we have our	-
8:10:58	newest payment right here and it is looking great so this is it the deployed	-
8:11:05	store finally let me show you how easily you can add new items or remove and even	-
8:11:12	edit the current items using sanity you don't have to go back to the code you	-
8:11:17	can do everything straight from their interface so if the price changes for	-
8:11:21	these specific headphones you can modify it really easily or if you want to	-
8:11:25	change the images the title or anything else it is incredibly simple so what we	-
8:11:32	can do is we can go back to our project and in here we can just manage the	-
8:11:37	project details but now since the project is deployed we also need to	-
8:11:41	deploy the sanity Studio all and that is also going to be incredibly simple so	-
8:11:47	let's go back to our code let's open up the terminal let's CD into sanity	-
8:11:52	e-commerce and I think that even running the command sanity help is going to tell	-
8:11:58	us what we need to do to deploy it so as you can see we have a lot of	-
8:12:03	different commands right here and there is a deploy command of course there is	-
8:12:08	to make it incredibly simple so we can run sanity deploy	-
8:12:13	and this is immediately going to get the project info for the hostname I'm going	-
8:12:18	to type eCommerce Dash JSM and Sanity is building it out and there we go in just	-
8:12:26	under half a minute we have success Studio deployed 2 and we can control	-
8:12:31	click this link connecting to sanity and there we go you can share this link with	-
8:12:37	people who own the store with your fellow developers copywriters or really	-
8:12:43	anyone who wants to edit the content and you can do that right here so if we	-
8:12:48	wanted to add a new product let's go right here let's add item	-
8:12:54	and let's add something interesting for example this smart watch right here	-
8:12:59	which we haven't seen so far there we go	-
8:13:03	we can say smart watch	-
8:13:06	the slug is going to be automatically generated the price is going to be 99	-
8:13:11	bucks and we can say cool smart watch	-
8:13:15	there we go and let's publish it now if we go back to our deployed site go back	-
8:13:21	to the home page and press Ctrl shift R to do a Reload while cleaning cache you	-
8:13:27	can see that our watch is going to appear right here instantly you can see	-
8:13:32	it you can buy it and everything is working perfectly that is the power of	-
8:13:38	integrated headless software such as stripe but most importantly sanity	-
8:13:44	everything is working perfectly you can hand this over to your client to the	-
8:13:48	store owner and everything will be fine great so that part is now done our	-
8:13:55	sanity desk is deployed and if we go right here and reload the page	-
8:14:00	you should be able to see there we go our studio is now deployed and when it	-
8:14:05	comes to the usage there is no way we're going to go past these limits we've done	-
8:14:11	216 requests and we can do 1 million same thing goes for all of these other	-
8:14:17	metrics we have plenty more to go so working with sanity is phenomenal they	-
8:14:23	even decided to sponsor this video to allow me to build such an amazing	-
8:14:27	e-commerce application do you know the best way to Showcase your skills to	-
8:14:32	employers or potential clients is the CV going to cut it in today's world most	-
8:14:38	clients are looking for digital presence and if you don't already have one now is	-
8:14:44	the time to start presenting a well-digitilized flexible	-
8:14:48	portfolio will definitely make you stand out from the crowd hello there and	-
8:14:54	welcome to a project video where you'll build and deploy your own ultimate web	-
8:15:00	development portfolio from scratch the portfolio you'll build in this video is	-
8:15:06	like no other portfolio page you've ever seen so far you can change the content	-
8:15:12	of this beautifully designed website within minutes at any time from anywhere	-
8:15:18	as your skills grow this portfolio will grow with you	-
8:15:23	usually the process of creating a premium custom portfolio would take you	-
8:15:28	weeks if not months to complete thankfully I'm going to teach you how	-
8:15:33	you can do this in just one video so that you can use all the extra time to	-
8:15:38	build projects you're going to fill the portfolio with	-
8:15:42	I'll also teach you how you can make all of the content on this page completely	-
8:15:47	modifiable through a modern content platform	
8:15:51	foreign [Music]	
8:15:58	as we always do we're going to start from bare Beginnings by creating an	-
8:16:03	empty folder on our desktop I'm going to name it JSM underscore	-
8:16:08	portfolio but feel free to use any name you like	-
8:16:12	after you have your empty folder open up your code editor of choice in this case	-
8:16:18	I'll be using visual studio code and I can simply drag and drop the folder into	-
8:16:23	an empty Visual Studio code window once we're in here we can go to view and	-
8:16:29	then terminal we can also run the clear command to have a clean working	-
8:16:33	environment in here we'll be able to initialize our react application but	-
8:16:39	also our sanity Studio so in this case before initializing our	-
8:16:44	new react application let's create an empty folder for our sanity backend we	-
8:16:50	can right click right here and create a new folder called backend	-
8:16:56	underscore sanity to start off and come to this page you	-
8:17:02	can click the link in the description the sanity CMS theme was kind enough to	-
8:17:07	provide you with double the free included monthly usage that includes 200	-
8:17:14	000 API requests 1 million API CDN requests and 20 Gigabytes of bandwidth	-
8:17:22	that's going to be more than enough for 99.9 of people myself included	-
8:17:28	so what we can do is copy this or press right here	-
8:17:33	go back into our application change the directory or CD into back insanity	-
8:17:41	and then we can simply paste what we copied this is going to install sanity	-
8:17:46	CLI globally and then we can press enter one more time which is going to	-
8:17:50	initialize our new sanity project with the JavaScript Mastery coupon code	-
8:17:56	applied so with that said we are now inside of sanity's command line	-
8:18:01	interface and we'll have to answer a few questions so that sanity sets up the	-
8:18:06	best project structure for us the first thing we have to do is to log in in this	-
8:18:12	case I'm going to log in using Google so I'm simply going to press enter there we	-
8:18:18	go login successful now we can simply close this tab and return to the	-
8:18:22	terminal the second thing we have to do is choose a project name so in this case	-
8:18:28	I'm going to do JSM underscore portfolio in your case feel free to use whatever	-
8:18:34	you'd like in here we can just press Y and then	-
8:18:38	press enter to use the default data set configuration	
8:18:42	and for the project output path we can simply press enter Because the default	-
8:18:47	configuration pad has been already chosen	
8:18:50	and finally sanity offers a lot of predefined templates so that you can	-
8:18:55	quickly start with your project you can choose a movie Project an e-commerce	-
8:19:00	Project Blog or in our case we're going to start with a clear project with no	-
8:19:07	predified schemas I'm going to teach you how to do absolutely everything from	-
8:19:12	scratch right now sanity CLI is creating the default project files everything is	-
8:19:18	being set up as we speak let's give it a minute and then we'll be right back	-
8:19:24	and the setup has been successful now we can run sanity docs to open up the	-
8:19:30	documentation sanity managed to open the project settings sanity help to explore	-
8:19:36	the manual but most importantly we can run Sandy start to open up our studio so	-
8:19:42	let's go ahead and do just that sanity start	
8:19:47	sanity star just started I went ahead and sped out the process for you but	-
8:19:51	most importantly we can now go to localhost	
8:19:55	3333 so let's go ahead and control click it	
8:20:00	in here we'll also have to log in and this is our sanity desk right now we	-
8:20:09	have an empty schema meaning that we have to add new schemas to our project	-
8:20:13	so for now we can stop this from running by pressing Ctrl C	-
8:20:19	and we can focus on checking out all the files and folders that are created for	-
8:20:24	us by sanity most importantly the only thing we care	-
8:20:29	about here is the schemas folder and right now we just have one schema.js	-
8:20:35	file right here to create our first real schema we can	-
8:20:41	right click under schemas and create a new file	-
8:20:44	let's go ahead and create the schema for our testimonials first	-
8:20:50	so testimonials.js inside of here we can simply write plain	-
8:20:56	JavaScript code for example export default and our entire schema is going	-
8:21:04	to be just one object inside of our schema we're going to have	-
8:21:08	some properties we need to have a name which is going to be testimonials	-
8:21:14	then we're going to have the title which is going to be the same thing but with a	-
8:21:20	capital T then we have to have a type of that	-
8:21:24	specific schema and the type is going to be document	-
8:21:29	and finally we need to specify an array of fields that are testimonials object	-
8:21:35	is going to have and the fields are going to be objects	-
8:21:40	the first object has to have a name and the name in this case is actually going	-
8:21:46	to be the name the name of the person leaving the testimonial	-
8:21:50	then we're going to have a title so we're following the same structure as we	-
8:21:55	already have here and that title is going to be name	-
8:22:00	and finally the type of our name is going to be string now we can duplicate	-
8:22:06	this object three more times one two three	
8:22:11	and for the second one we're gonna say company so name is actually going to be	-
8:22:17	the company title company with the capital i c and it's also going to be a	-
8:22:23	string then we need to have the image URL of	
8:22:27	the person leaving the testimonial and that's also going to be IMG URL like	-
8:22:34	this and finally this is going to be of a Type image and when we have images we	-
8:22:40	also have to provide options which is an object where we're going to have hotspot	-
8:22:46	is equal to true now so far all of this seemed incredibly intuitive we have	-
8:22:54	object with names titles and types and everything is as we're writing plain	-
8:22:59	JavaScript now this is the first time that you	
8:23:02	might think what this hotspot actually means well the key is whenever you're	-
8:23:07	using some kind of software always look through the documentation one Google	-
8:23:12	search is going to lead you to docs presenting images and then if you search	-
8:23:17	for Hotspot you can immediately see what does that mean that simply means that	-
8:23:23	the user will be able to choose the crop while uploading the image this is the	-
8:23:28	feature that you would have to implement on your own if we weren't using sanity	-
8:23:32	with that said the final thing in our testimonial which is going to be the	-
8:23:37	feedback message of course feedback with a capital f and that is also going to be	-
8:23:42	a string and we just wrote our first schema we can go back into schema.js and	-
8:23:49	right here we can import it by saying import	
8:23:53	testimonials and that's going to be coming from dot slash testimonials and	-
8:23:59	finally we just have to add our schema in the array of types right here we're	-
8:24:05	just gonna type testimonials and that is it now we can go to view and	-
8:24:12	then terminal and let's run sanity start one more time to see if something	-
8:24:18	happened in our sanity desk we can control click the link	-
8:24:23	and as you can now see this looks quite different now we actually have the	-
8:24:28	content here and you can see our first document which is testimonials now we	-
8:24:34	can click right here and click create and you'll be able to create a new	-
8:24:39	document instantly in here we have some references for our old social media	-
8:24:44	project that's a nice throwback but that's not going to be helpful in this	-
8:24:49	case where we can simply use the name such as Michael	-
8:24:54	the company can be Google I found an interesting person on Google	-
8:24:58	and we can simply drag and drop there we go	-
8:25:03	now of course you can click this pencil right here and we can crop him out to	-
8:25:08	make a perfect circle just like this well it's not perfect but it should be	-
8:25:14	good enough and finally what is he going to say well	-
8:25:18	let's say great job would recommend and we can click publish as soon as we	-
8:25:27	clicked publish the document is live what they've done just now is basically	-
8:25:32	implemented an entire database think about that we've created a schema and	-
8:25:38	added the ability for users to add new content to that database how crazy is	-
8:25:44	that imagine if we were working on a marine application mongodb Express react	-
8:25:51	and node just imagine how much time would we have to spend just to come to	-
8:25:55	this point where we're at right now it will take hours to set everything up but	-
8:26:01	we've done it in a couple of minutes using sanity now that you understand how	-
8:26:06	adding schemas work we can go back to our Visual Studio code and we can	-
8:26:10	continue adding all of the other necessary schemas	-
8:26:14	since the process for adding all of these schemas is going to be basically	-
8:26:18	identical I'm going to leave a link to the folder containing all of the files	-
8:26:24	for all the necessary schemas then you can simply drag and drop in just like	-
8:26:29	that all of the other schemas are going to get populated right in here	-
8:26:34	everything from Works Brands about experiences everything is right here and	-
8:26:41	as you can see this is nothing more than what you've seen so far if we go back to	-
8:26:46	our sanity desk now you can see that the schemas for the entirety of our content	-
8:26:51	are right here right now there is our testimonial and as we go through the	-
8:26:57	application it's going to be incredibly useful that we already have all of this	-
8:27:01	coded out with that said our work on the back end is now fully done now we can	-
8:27:08	start creating our front-end application and then later on we're going to connect	-
8:27:13	the two so let's press Ctrl C clear it	-
8:27:18	to initialize our react application we can run MPX create Dash react Dash app	-
8:27:25	and we can simply call it front-end underscore react	-
8:27:31	this is going to initialize our entire react application in this folder while	-
8:27:36	this is initializing I definitely want to say that it's been amazing using	-
8:27:40	sanity so far it's really simple and efficient in a matter of few minutes	-
8:27:45	we've created an entire database and we can immediately start adding documents	-
8:27:50	to that database as we go so it's going to be incredibly fun connecting this to	-
8:27:56	the react application that we're going to create right now in that application	-
8:28:00	is as you've seen in the intro the ultimate web development portfolio so	-
8:28:06	let's wait until our react application is initialized and then we'll Dive Right	-
8:28:11	In to start with our react.js application we can first open up the	-
8:28:16	front-end react folder and see what we have in there	-
8:28:20	the most important in here is the source folder where the entirety of our react	-
8:28:25	application is going to be in as you can see we have a lot of files here with	-
8:28:30	already some predefined code but we won't be using any of that so what I	-
8:28:35	like to do is right click the source and then completely delete it then you can	-
8:28:41	right click the front and react and create a new folder also called SRC	-
8:28:46	inside of there we can create a file that every single react application	-
8:28:51	needs to have and that is the index.js file	
8:28:55	inside of here we can import react from react and this is also the only file	-
8:29:02	where we're going to import react Dom from react Dom	-
8:29:07	this is going to help us connect with our HTML file we are also going to	-
8:29:13	import the app component which we don't already have but we can just write this	-
8:29:17	here for the future so from that slash app and then we can	-
8:29:23	also import the dot slash index.css which we also don't already	-
8:29:28	have but we're soon going to create it and finally we can say react Dom dot	-
8:29:35	render and we can render our app right here and then say document dot get	-
8:29:41	element by ID and we need to get a div with an ID of root	-
8:29:47	let me explain what does this line actually do	-
8:29:50	if we go into the public folder and then index.html inside of here you can see	-
8:29:55	that we have some meta tags but I'm going to space it up properly we have	-
8:30:00	some comments some links but most importantly we just have a body	-
8:30:06	with a single div and that div has an ID of root so in	-
8:30:13	this case we're going to put our entire react application right here inside of	-
8:30:17	this div with an idea of root and that is exactly what we've done right here we	-
8:30:23	connected our app straight to the div with an ID of root with that said of	-
8:30:28	course now we need to create our app.js so right here create a new file app	-
8:30:35	dot JS inside of the source folder our app is going to be a simple react	-
8:30:42	functional component so we can run rafce this is going to instantly create	-
8:30:48	a simple react functional component if this didn't autofill for you you can	-
8:30:54	go to extensions and then search for es7 Snippets	
8:30:59	and then we should see es7 plus react Redux react native Snippets you can	-
8:31:05	install it and then once you type rafce you should get your component right here	-
8:31:11	we'll be using this a few times across this entire application but if this	-
8:31:15	doesn't work for you for any reason you can of course type it out by hand	-
8:31:19	inside of our app later on we're going to import all of our other components	-
8:31:24	but for now let's just leave it empty like this and I always like to end	-
8:31:29	everything with semicolons so we're going to add them right here now we have	-
8:31:33	our app but we're missing the second piece of the puzzle which is the	-
8:31:37	index.css so let's create a new file right here called	-
8:31:43	index.css this CSS file is going to contain just some basic setup so down in	-
8:31:50	the description you'll be able to find a link for this entire CSS file which is	-
8:31:55	less than 20 lines and as you can see it only has a font import and the setup of	-
8:32:01	some basic colors that's about it so again just find it below copy and paste	-
8:32:06	it into index.css once you've done that we have to install all the necessary	-
8:32:12	dependencies needed to run our react application	
8:32:16	so in this case we can go to view and then terminal	-
8:32:20	right here you can clear it if it's not clear already	-
8:32:24	to install all of the necessary dependencies we're gonna use throughout	-
8:32:28	this project we first need to CD or change the directory into front-end	-
8:32:34	react there we can run npm install and then we	
8:32:38	can start listing out all the dependencies that we need for our	-
8:32:42	project the first one is going to be add sanity	
8:32:47	forward slash client then we're going to need add sanity	-
8:32:51	forward slash image Dash URL then we're going to need framer Dash	-
8:32:57	motion for the animations as well as node Dash SAS for our scss	-
8:33:04	files we're gonna also use react Dash icons	
8:33:09	for all the icons that you'll be able to see on the page and I think that should	-
8:33:13	be it if you're missing something we can	-
8:33:16	easily install it later on this process should take about a minute	-
8:33:21	so I'll be right back and there we go all of the packages have	-
8:33:26	been installed and you can see them inside of our packet Json inside of the	-
8:33:31	front and react so now if we go back to our index you	-
8:33:37	can see that we have this app we have this index and everything seems to be	-
8:33:41	ready to go instead of having this as a div let's just change this to H1 so that	-
8:33:46	we can see it more clearly once we run our application	-
8:33:50	and to run it the only thing you have to do is press npm start and then press	-
8:33:55	enter this is going to open up the application	
8:33:59	on localhost 3000 and there we go if we've done everything	-
8:34:04	correctly so far we can see an H1 that simply says app but now is the time that	-
8:34:10	we implement the entire file and folder structure for our project so it's easier	-
8:34:16	for us to develop it as we go along so first of all we're going to create a	-
8:34:21	few folders inside of the source the first folder we can create is of	-
8:34:26	course going to be the components folder this is going to be for all of our	-
8:34:30	smaller components then we're going to have the assets folder and that's going	-
8:34:36	to be for all of our images which will be able to download from this video	-
8:34:39	later on then we're going to have a constants	-
8:34:43	folder and this is going to be for imports of	
8:34:46	all of the files that we're going to constantly use	-
8:34:49	then we're going to need our container file and this is going to be for all of	-
8:34:54	our bigger containers meaning components containing multiple components inside of	-
8:34:59	themselves and these are the most important folders	
8:35:03	that we need to have but of course the files are what actually matters so let's	-
8:35:09	go ahead and create some containers first	
8:35:12	each one of our containers is going to be another folder and it's going to say	-
8:35:17	the name of our component or a container so the first one can be about and then	-
8:35:22	inside of there we're going to create the about dot jsx file as well as about	-
8:35:29	dot scss file then we can create a new folder inside	-
8:35:35	of the container which is going to be our footer	-
8:35:38	inside of the footer we're going to repeat the process	-
8:35:41	footer.jsx as well as footer dot scss we're going to also need a header so	-
8:35:50	let's add a header component or a container and that's going to be header	-
8:35:55	dot jsx as well as header Dot scss and of course I'm going to	-
8:36:03	explain later on why we're using scss and not CSS and why is it Superior	-
8:36:09	then we're going to have our skills section	
8:36:13	inside of the skills we're gonna of course have	-
8:36:16	skills.jsx as well as skills Dot scss finally we're gonna need a testimonial	-
8:36:25	which is going to have a testimonial Dot jsx	-
8:36:31	as well as testimonial Dot scss and one last folder is going to	-
8:36:39	be work to Showcase all of our works which is going to have work.jsx as well	-
8:36:45	as work Dot scss that's great now we have all of these	-
8:36:53	components and we can start by creating the basic boilerplate structure for all	-
8:36:58	of them so let's start from top to bottom and let's simply write rafce and	-
8:37:04	press enter this is going to create the about	-
8:37:07	section while right here we can also import the	
8:37:12	dot slash about Dot scss and we can copy that because we're going to need that	-
8:37:17	for all the other components so now let's repeat the process let's go	-
8:37:22	to footer rafce enter and then simply paste this	-
8:37:28	here and change it to footer.scss I know this is a lot of manual work but	-
8:37:35	if we do this at the start it's going to be so much easier to code the	-
8:37:39	application later on now let's move to our header again rafce	-
8:37:45	paste this here and change it to header let's repeat the process for skills	-
8:37:52	paste the Styles here change it to skills and only two more	-
8:37:57	times left to go raf-ce for testimonial	-
8:38:01	as well as testimonial.scss and finally work right here we can again	-
8:38:08	paste this line and change it to work now we're done with all of our	-
8:38:13	containers and we are ready to start importing them straight inside of our	-
8:38:18	app so if we go here we could do something	
8:38:21	like this import let's say about from dot slash container forward slash	-
8:38:29	about and then we can repeat this process for every single component but	-
8:38:35	as you can see that would clutter our view inside of the app.jss so one great	-
8:38:40	reaction trick I can give you is to export all of these components straight	-
8:38:46	from the container so the only thing you have to do to make	-
8:38:50	this happen is right click container click new file and create an index.js	-
8:38:56	file inside of it there we can simply say export	-
8:39:00	default as and then the name of the component for example about and then	-
8:39:06	from dot slash about forward slash about and we can repeat this process for as	-
8:39:13	many components as we have so the second one on our list is going to be footer by	-
8:39:18	the way to highlight all of these things I'm holding alt and then double clicking	-
8:39:22	the words that way I can change everything at once	-
8:39:27	so we're going to repeat the process for header	
8:39:30	for skills as well then we're gonna do testimonial and	-
8:39:36	finally that's going to be work great now with this file allow this to	-
8:39:44	do is to go back into app and now we can import components instead of as a	-
8:39:49	default import we can use curly braces right here and then we can list all of	-
8:39:55	our components one by one in one single line that's going to be about	-
8:40:01	footer Heather	
8:40:03	skills testimonial and work	
8:40:08	and all of that is coming from that slash container this is much more	-
8:40:14	readable the only thing we can do right now is create a div right here	-
8:40:21	that div is going to have a class name equal to app we're going to add it later	-
8:40:28	on but now in here we can list all of our components one by one that's going	-
8:40:34	to be Heather as a self-closing component then we're going to have about	-
8:40:40	below that we're gonna have work then we're gonna have skills finally	-
8:40:47	testimonial and at the end of course footer with our	
8:40:52	contact page the only components we're missing is	-
8:40:56	going to be our navigation bar and that's for our reason our navigation bar	-
8:41:00	is not going to be a container rather it's going to be a simple component	-
8:41:06	so what we can do is go inside of the components create a new folder called	-
8:41:11	navbar inside of there we can create a nav bar	
8:41:16	dot jsx file and also a navbar DOT scss file	
8:41:24	inside of there we can repeat the process rafce and then import dot slash	-
8:41:30	navbar Dot scss we can do the same situation inside the	-
8:41:35	components create an index.js file where we can say export default as navbar	-
8:41:45	from dot slash navbar forward slash navbar	
8:41:50	now if we go back into the app we can repeat the process by saying import	-
8:41:56	navbar from dot slash components and we can list it right here of course at the	-
8:42:03	top great now we have all of the components	
8:42:08	and containers that we're gonna use throughout our application so let's	-
8:42:13	check it out in the browser if we've done everything correctly you should be	-
8:42:17	able to zoom in by holding Ctrl and then using a mouse wheel to see all of our	-
8:42:22	components right here of course this is looking awful right	-
8:42:26	now we just have a white empty page with all of the components but each component	-
8:42:32	is just a div containing the word which is the name of that component of course	-
8:42:37	now our goal is to properly style and implement the logic for every single one	-
8:42:42	of these sections which are at the end of this video going to form a beautiful	-
8:42:47	react portfolio so I know this was a lot of manual work but are you ready to	-
8:42:53	start coding this out we are of course going to start from top to bottom	-
8:42:56	implement the navbar header and then go to all the most exciting sections which	-
8:43:02	is the about and the portfolio section just one final thing we have to do	-
8:43:07	before starting implementing our navbar is just implementing some general styles	-
8:43:12	that we're going to use across our entire application	-
8:43:15	remember this index.css well we have to use these colors somewhere and we also	-
8:43:21	have to implement this basic app class name so to do that we can create a new	-
8:43:26	file inside of the source called app.scss	
8:43:31	and this is the last time that I'm going to provide you with some code but this	-
8:43:36	file simply contains the setup for all of the things we've done before using	-
8:43:41	the primary color inside of the app specifying some classes with some	-
8:43:46	background colors primary backgrounds and then setting up the container sizing	-
8:43:51	and so on again there isn't a lot of real logic here it's mainly setting up	-
8:43:57	classes that we're going to use later on for example instead of using these three	-
8:44:01	lines every time we want to Center something we'll be just able to use this	-
8:44:06	one single class and the situation is the same with all of the other classes	-
8:44:11	added here they're just here to help us with the future development	-
8:44:15	so to link to this scss code is going to be down in the description as well	-
8:44:20	inside of a GitHub gist once that is done we should be able to just import it	-
8:44:25	inside of the app.js by saying import dot slash app Dot scss and now we are	-
8:44:34	ready to start creating our portfolio before we do that let's just open up the	-
8:44:39	browser and see what changes that this app.css file do there we go you can see	-
8:44:45	that the only thing that happened was applying some fonts and also this	-
8:44:48	background color that you can see right here with that said we are ready to	-
8:44:53	start with the first section and component of our portfolio which is the	-
8:44:58	navigation bar now that we're starting to code our components it might be a	-
8:45:03	good idea to put the browser and the editor side by side so that we can see	-
8:45:07	the changes we code live to do that I'm going to collapse our	-
8:45:12	Explorer and then open up the browser and there we go this is already looking	-
8:45:17	better we can see what we're doing just on the side	-
8:45:20	so let's start with our navigation bar this is going to be an HTML5 semantic	-
8:45:26	tag called nav inside of this nav we're going to have a few components more	-
8:45:33	specifically we're going to have a div and this div is going to contain our	-
8:45:37	logo so right inside of it we can add an image that's going to have a source	-
8:45:43	equal to images dot logo every image also needs to have an ALT or	-
8:45:49	an alternative tag and that's going to Simply say logo	-
8:45:54	now you might be wondering where are these images coming from	-
8:45:58	as I've told you I'm going to provide you with all the assets for this project	-
8:46:02	so down below in the description you'll be able to find a zipped assets folder	-
8:46:07	you can simply unzip it and then paste it straight into the source folder there	-
8:46:13	we go I copied mine I'm gonna delete the original and just rename this to assets	-
8:46:19	as soon as you do that you can notice that you're going to have a lot of	-
8:46:22	images about one two three four and then images of Brands as well as	-
8:46:30	some backgrounds everything is prepared for you now that we have those images	-
8:46:35	just so we don't have to import one by one each time we're gonna do a similar	-
8:46:40	thing that we've done with the components using that one single	-
8:46:44	index.js file so inside of the constants we can create	-
8:46:48	an images dot JS file inside of there we're going to Simply	-
8:46:54	import every single image and then export it again the images.js file is	-
8:47:00	going to be in a gist down below as you can see just importing every single	-
8:47:06	image there is and then exporting it so that we can more easily import it in one	-
8:47:10	line with a meaningful name and of course we can create one index.js	-
8:47:16	file right here in the constants to export all of these images that's going	-
8:47:22	to look something like this export default as images and then that's going	-
8:47:28	to be coming from that slash images what this is going to allow us to do is	-
8:47:34	to go back into navbar and now simply we can say import	-
8:47:40	images from dot slash dot slash constants and	
8:47:46	every time you have to use something from images you'll always be able to	-
8:47:50	import this same line and then all of our files are going to be right in here	-
8:47:56	in this images object that's the exact reason why we're doing this	-
8:48:02	and again I know that there is some code you have to write but trust me this is a	-
8:48:07	pro tip that's going to help you with importing all of these images because	-
8:48:10	you don't have to worry about file names and you also don't have to import all of	-
8:48:15	them in a new line imagine usually you would have to import every single file	-
8:48:20	in your line but now all of the images are right here in this one images object	-
8:48:26	isn't that great okay so now we have our logo you can see it right here Mikhail	-
8:48:32	or Michael as we said and right now we can continue with our navigation bar	-
8:48:37	below this div we're going to have a UL or an unordered list	-
8:48:42	this unordered list is going to Loop through all of the elements that we need	-
8:48:47	to have in our navigation bar so we can open a dynamic block of code	-
8:48:51	create an array and there start listing all of the elements such as home about	-
8:48:58	then we're going to also have work skills	
8:49:03	and finally contact once you have that array we can call a	-
8:49:08	DOT map on it create an instant return function like	-
8:49:13	this where we don't have a curly brace here	
8:49:16	we just have a regular parenthesis so for each one of our items we're gonna	-
8:49:22	get that item meaning contact skills work and so on and we want to return	-
8:49:27	something more specifically we want to return a	
8:49:31	list item that list item has to have a key which	-
8:49:36	is going to be equal to a template string saying link Dash and then item to	-
8:49:42	make it unique inside of our Li we're going to have an	-
8:49:46	empty div that will be able to style later on and then of course we're going	-
8:49:51	to have an anchor tag that's going to have an href equal to a template string	-
8:49:56	of hash and then item this is going to lead us straight to that section of the	-
8:50:02	page and inside of the anchor tag we can simply render the item	-
8:50:07	let's save it and right now you can see that this just	-
8:50:11	created the links for all of our sections home about contact work skills	-
8:50:16	and contact looks like we have contact two times so this one is extra there we	-
8:50:23	go so this is going to be our navigation	
8:50:26	bar for the desktop devices but of course this isn't looking like a navbar	-
8:50:30	so far what we have to do is of course implement the styles	-
8:50:35	so our nav is going to have a class name equal to	-
8:50:40	app underscore underscore and have bar and this underscore underscore is a part	-
8:50:45	of Ben methodology by doing a simple Google search you'll be able to see that	-
8:50:50	you can create clean CSS with bam methodology bem is essentially a	-
8:50:56	front-end naming method so it isn't any kind of framework or library or stuff	-
8:51:01	like that it is simply a naming method a naming method that's going to help you	-
8:51:05	know which elements are you styling block element modifier I'm going to	-
8:51:10	leave a link about this down in the description so if you want to read more	-
8:51:15	you can definitely do that our div is also going to have a class	-
8:51:20	name equal to app underscore underscore navbar Dash logo and then our URL is	-
8:51:27	also going to have a class name equal to app underscore underscore navbar Dash	-
8:51:33	links and of course our individual link also	
8:51:37	has to have a class name which is going to be equal to app underscore underscore	-
8:51:42	Flex we discuss that this is going to Center	
8:51:45	the element and then finally p dash text which is going to make it a paragraph	-
8:51:51	text and this is going to be it for now but	
8:51:54	of course we have to implement the styles to be able to see the changes so	-
8:51:58	let's clean up our working environment by closing all of the files we're	-
8:52:02	currently not using you can hold Ctrl and then press w a few times but make	-
8:52:07	sure that you're in the visual studio code window	-
8:52:11	there we go we're going to close all of that and just open up the things that we	-
8:52:17	need front and react Source components navbar and we also need a navbar.scss	-
8:52:25	so let's start with styling the nav bar that's going to be that app underscore	-
8:52:31	underscore navbar and let's give it a width of 100 percent	-
8:52:37	then let's also make it a display is equal to flex	-
8:52:41	justify Dash content is equal to space between and align Dash items is equal to	-
8:52:48	Center okay now we have our logo on the left	
8:52:52	side and all of our links on the right side	
8:52:55	let's also provide a bit of padding like one ram on top and bottom and two RAM on	-
8:53:01	left and right there we go this is looking more like it right now	-
8:53:05	it would be also called to provide a light background so we can say	-
8:53:09	background is equal to rgba 255 255 255 which is going to be a plain	-
8:53:17	white color but we can provide opacity of 0.25 that's going to make it just a	-
8:53:24	bit lighter and it's going to appear like it's above the current background	-
8:53:28	one cool CSS property is the backdrop Dash filter in here we can see blur off	-
8:53:36	around 4 pixels and it's hard to notice right now but once we scroll later on	-
8:53:41	you'll be able to notice that there is kind of a blurry background around the	-
8:53:46	navigation bar and since this property is not available on all browsers we have	-
8:53:51	to copy it paste it below and then say dash webkit	-
8:53:56	dash backdrop Dash filter and then keep it at blur is for let's also add a	-
8:54:03	border of one pixel solid rgba 255 255 255 and then	-
8:54:12	0.18 I found that color to work best for the Border it's barely noticeable our	-
8:54:19	navigation bar is going to have a position equal to fixed so that it stays	-
8:54:24	on top and there we go now you can see the backdrop I was talking about it's	-
8:54:29	blurred behind and we also want to provide a z index of	-
8:54:33	2 to make it appear above the content there we go now let's style this logo a	-
8:54:40	bit and we can do that by saying that app underscore underscore navbar Dash	-
8:54:45	logo display is going to be Flex	
8:54:50	justify Dash content is going to be Flex Dash start	-
8:54:55	and align Dash items is going to be Center	
8:55:00	that's going to space it up just a bit but now check this out this is going to	-
8:55:05	be the magic of using scss instead of repeating this entire class and then	-
8:55:11	targeting the image inside of it to create a completely new style sheet	-
8:55:16	right here below the current one what you can do with scss is have nesting	-
8:55:22	properties so if we're already talking about this	
8:55:26	why create a new class we can simply take this image and say	-
8:55:31	Target the image that's inside of the app navbar logo that makes more sense	-
8:55:38	because if you look at the jsx there actually is an image tag inside of a div	-
8:55:44	with a class name app not Bar logo so this just makes more sense and it	-
8:55:50	saves some lines of code let's change the width to be 90 pixels	-
8:55:55	and also the height to be something like let's do 20.	-
8:56:00	there we go one crazy thing about this is that we can keep nesting however we	-
8:56:06	want and we can also add media queries straight for specific elements like	-
8:56:12	right here we can say media screen and Min Dash width is 2000 pixels so this is	-
8:56:19	going to be for extra large devices there we want to increase the width and	-
8:56:24	the height a bit so we can copy this	-
8:56:27	and change the width to be 180 pixels and height to be 40 pixels of course	-
8:56:34	this is only noticeable on extra large devices but I just wanted to show you	-
8:56:39	that we can add media queries straight inside of the elements or specific	-
8:56:43	classes now let's move on to our links which	
8:56:47	look quite ugly right now that's going to be dot app underscore underscore	-
8:56:52	navbar Dash links there we can set the flex to be equal to	-
8:56:57	1 like this that's going to make this div take out the rest of the space that	-
8:57:03	logo doesn't take then we can make this container display	-
8:57:07	Flex justify content Center and align Dash items center now they're	-
8:57:15	appearing in a row because as soon as you apply the display Flex property	-
8:57:19	everything appears in a row then we want to apply the list style equal to none	-
8:57:25	but I think that's already applied because we use the p-text stack then we	-
8:57:31	can Target the individual Li item inside of the app not bar links let's give them	-
8:57:37	some margin like zero and then one ram okay this is already looking just a bit	-
8:57:42	better of course the cursor needs to be pointer	
8:57:46	because the user needs to know that this is actually clickable and we're gonna	-
8:57:50	change the flex Dash direction to be equal to column now remember inside of	-
8:57:56	this Li there is a div and there is an anchor tag and using scss we can	-
8:58:03	specifically Target this div that's inside of the LI as well as the anchor	-
8:58:08	tag that's inside of the Li and apply specific styles to them	-
8:58:13	so this Dev is going to have a width of 5 pixels it's also going to have a	-
8:58:19	height of 5 pixels it's going to have a background which is transparent and it's	-
8:58:25	also going to have a border Dash radius of 50 percent	-
8:58:30	finally let's apply a margin bottom of 5 pixels	
8:58:35	as soon as we save that you won't be able to notice the changes yet but as we	-
8:58:40	style the anchor tag you'll be able to see the things that these changes made	-
8:58:45	so for our anchor tag let's change the color to be equal to VAR and then dash	-
8:58:52	dash gray Dash color so in here we're actually using the CSS	-
8:58:57	variables that we created right inside of our	-
8:59:01	index.css this is great for theme colors that you'll be reusing across your	-
8:59:06	entire application then let's set the text decoration to be equal to none to	-
8:59:12	remove that ugly underline there we go it's already starting to look more like	-
8:59:17	it let's change the flex direction to be equal to column also of course text	-
8:59:23	transform is going to be uppercase okay that's looking more like it right now	-
8:59:28	and let's also add the fonts Dash weight to 500 which is going to make it Bolder	-
8:59:34	in this case let's also apply a transition	
8:59:39	and transition is going to be all 0.3 seconds and ease in out this	-
8:59:46	transition will be visible once we add the hover	-
8:59:50	and take a look at this instead of writing a new class A and then hover	-
8:59:56	like this you can immediately just put a dollar sign here which means that this	-
9:00:02	is referring to the element we're inside of and then hover so now you know that	-
9:00:07	this hover is referring to this anchor tag right here	-
9:00:11	inside of this hover we want to change the color of the anchor tag to VAR dash	-
9:00:17	dash secondary Dash color now if we save that you can see that our	-
9:00:24	color slowly transitions into blue it's a quick transition doesn't take a few	-
9:00:30	seconds but rather just 0.3 seconds to get to full blue color great	-
9:00:36	now we also want to add a hover to our Li so you know what to do right here we	-
9:00:43	have to find where our Li is and it's ending right here so we can say and	-
9:00:49	hover inside of this hover we're going to want	
9:00:53	to Target the div and change the background color to be equal to VAR dash	-
9:00:58	dash secondary Dash color so if we save that you can notice that	-
9:01:04	now we have this Dot and that is what that div was for you can see with 5	-
9:01:09	pixels hide 5 pixels and then board the radius 50 to make it in a circle so now	-
9:01:16	this is looking great once you actually hover over it you get that dot	-
9:01:20	indicating that you want to go to that section and if we look at the finished	-
9:01:25	application and hover over these you can see that we've achieved the desired	-
9:01:29	State regarding our navigation bar but what happens on mobile devices we	-
9:01:35	cannot fit all these properties so we have to turn this into a hamburger menu	-
9:01:39	once you click over it then everything pops up from the right side that is	-
9:01:45	going to be our next task so we have to go back into our nav bar and below it we	-
9:01:50	have to implement the mobile navigation bar	
9:01:53	right below our UL we're going to create a div element right here that's going to	-
9:01:59	have a class name equal to app underscore underscore navbar Dash menu	-
9:02:07	and in there first of all we just want to have one icon so let's go ahead and	-
9:02:12	import the icons at the top we're going to need two different icons so we can	-
9:02:17	say import hi menu alt 4 as well as the hi X and	-
9:02:26	these are coming from react Dash icons forward slash hi	-
9:02:31	we're gonna also use frame or motion here so let's Import in curly braces as	-
9:02:37	well motion which is coming from framer Dash motion	-
9:02:43	now we can scroll down and just at the top right here we can use our first icon	-
9:02:49	which is a self-closing tag of hi menu Alt 4. and we're going to add an on	-
9:02:55	click property on it where we're going to have a callback function	-
9:03:00	and once somebody clicks it we're going to toggle the state so set toggle is set	-
9:03:07	to false of course this set toggle doesn't exist yet so just at the top we	-
9:03:12	can create a new state there is a cool shortcut you just start typing use State	-
9:03:17	and then you can click this use State snippet right here which is going to	-
9:03:23	create it for you now without moving your cursor just start typing the name	-
9:03:27	toggle press Tab and then you can immediately set the default value	-
9:03:33	the last thing we can do is simply import use state from react	-
9:03:39	now in here I miswrote this is going to be true because we want to open our menu	-
9:03:45	and then just below that we can create a dynamic code block where we can say if	-
9:03:51	toggle is true in that case we want to render our mobile navigation bar and we	-
9:03:58	can put this in one line like this now our navigation is going to be a Dev but	-
9:04:04	a special div a motion dot div so this is how you use framework motion	-
9:04:10	you just type motion and then the element you want to use	-
9:04:14	we're going to put this in multiple lines because we want to add some	-
9:04:17	properties to it more specifically while in view then that's going to be an	-
9:04:24	object that's going to have X property equal to 300 and then zero meaning it's	-
9:04:31	going to take 300 pixels and we also want to add a transition and that	-
9:04:37	transition is going to have a duration which is going to be 0.85 seconds and	-
9:04:44	also ease is going to be is out as a string	
9:04:49	of course if you want to learn more about all the properties that you can	-
9:04:53	use while using frame or motion you can check the framermotion.com site and in	-
9:04:59	here you can see the overview as well as all of the components and animations	-
9:05:04	that you can use so if you want to learn more on how to	-
9:05:09	create animations using framework motion definitely make sure to check out their	-
9:05:13	documentation but for this video I'm going to explain every single line that	-
9:05:18	we write if you'd like me to create a more detailed video on framer motion and	-
9:05:23	animations in react just feel free to like this video and let me know in the	-
9:05:28	comments I might do a project that's solely teaching you animations with that	-
9:05:33	said we can go back to our app and we can add something inside of that div	-
9:05:39	right here we of course have to have our X icon so that's going to be high X and	-
9:05:46	it's going to have an on click which we can basically copy from here the only	-
9:05:50	difference is that it's not going to be set to true but rather we want to close	-
9:05:55	it so it's going to be set to false and then inside of there we can simply copy	-
9:06:00	our entire menu list right here paste it just below our icon and let's see if we	-
9:06:06	have to change something rli is not going to have these properties at all	-
9:06:11	the only thing it's going to have is going to be the key but it's not going	-
9:06:15	to be link anymore we just want to show the item	-
9:06:19	so we want to differentiate these links from the links above	-
9:06:23	in this case we don't have to have this div and the anchor tag is going to still	-
9:06:29	be the same but we also want to close our navigation bar if the item is	-
9:06:35	clicked so on this anchor tag we can also add the non-click to close it once	-
9:06:41	we click on a specific link let me show you what I mean if we open up our	-
9:06:47	navigation bar and go to contact we want to close our navigation because we want	-
9:06:52	to see the actual section we're going to great so that part is now done of course	-
9:07:00	we are yet to implement the styles for this so let's see how is it going to	-
9:07:04	look right now so right now if we collapse it nothing is going to happen	-
9:07:09	so let's go to our Styles and we want to add something to the app navbar links so	-
9:07:15	you can click right here that's going to point you to the end of this specific	-
9:07:19	style and right here still inside of it we want to add a media query that's	-
9:07:25	going to be add media screen and we can set the max width to be equal to	-
9:07:32	something like 900 pixels so for devices wider than 900 pixels we want to set a	-
9:07:39	display is equal to none because we want to trigger a specific menu and there we	-
9:07:46	go now of course below this entire app nav bar links we can Target that app	-
9:07:52	underscore underscore navbar Dash menu and in here we can set the width to be	-
9:07:58	35 pixels height is going to be 35 pixels border	-
9:08:04	radius is going to be 50 percent and position is going to be relative	-
9:08:11	nothing is happening yet but let's add a few more Styles this play is going to be	-
9:08:17	set to flex justify Dash content is going to be	-
9:08:21	Center as well as the Align Dash items	
9:08:26	is going to be Center finally we want to change the background	-
9:08:31	color to be VAR dash dash secondary Dash color	
9:08:36	okay there we go we're working on this button right here and now let's target	-
9:08:42	the SVG inside of that button in here we can immediately Target the	-
9:08:47	SVG element let's give it a width of something like 70 percent	-
9:08:54	let's give it a height of 70 as well and the color can be VAR Dash Dash and then	-
9:09:01	that's going to be white Dash color there we go this is already looking more	-
9:09:08	like it now we want to Target a div that's below this SVG so we can say div	-
9:09:15	position is going to be fixed and if we save this nothing is going to	-
9:09:20	happen yet we can slowly see it if we one time click on this specific element	-
9:09:25	but it quickly disappears so let's keep adding more things to it until we can	-
9:09:30	see it for the entire time the top is going to be zero because we	-
9:09:35	want this menu bar to appear at the top the bottom is going to be zero as well	-
9:09:40	right is going to be set to 0 and then Z index is going to be set to 5.	-
9:09:46	let's also give it padding is equal to one ram width is going to be set to 80	-
9:09:52	percent not a hundred so let's change this to 80. there we go now we can see	-
9:09:58	what we're working on we have our home about work skills and contact	-
9:10:03	height is going to be set to 100 VH not percent VH which stands for vertical	-
9:10:10	height and now everything comes down to the bottom but a quick display Flex is	-
9:10:16	going to fix that then we have to add the justify Dash	-
9:10:21	content is going to be Flex Dash and align Dash items is going to be Flex	-
9:10:27	Dash and as well and flex attached direction is going to be set to column	-
9:10:34	now we can add the background in this case background is going to be URL dot	-
9:10:40	slash dot slash assets forward slash BG white dot B and G we cannot see it yet	-
9:10:48	but I think it just covered the text then we also want to add the background	-
9:10:53	Dash color equal to VAR dash dash white Dash color	-
9:10:59	we also want to use the background Dash size which is going to be cover and	-
9:11:06	finally background Dash repeat is going to be set to repeat	-
9:11:12	let's save it reload the page and if we click it now we can see that we have	-
9:11:18	this nice sidebar that pops up but we have our content at the bottom right	-
9:11:22	which doesn't look good just yet but we're going to fix that really soon	-
9:11:26	let's add a box Shadow on top so that's going to be box Shadow 0 0 and then 20	-
9:11:34	pixels and the color is going to be rgba I found the numbers 168 168 and then 168	-
9:11:44	and then the opacity 0.15 to work the best	-
9:11:49	so if we save this you can see this light Shadow up here right here	-
9:11:55	now we're still styling this div right here	
9:11:58	if you think about it that div is going to be the motion that we're talking	-
9:12:02	about but we also have an SVG inside of it	
9:12:06	which is going to be the close icon so now let's style the close icon remember	-
9:12:11	we're still inside of the div but now inside of the SVG as well I think we can	-
9:12:17	mostly copy what we had from the old SVG paste it here but the width and the	-
9:12:23	height are not going to be 70 they're going to be 35 pixels	-
9:12:27	and most importantly the color is not going to be white it's going to be	-
9:12:31	secondary now you can see this big close icon	
9:12:35	let's also add a bit of margin 0.5 RAM and 1 RAM on left and right finally and	-
9:12:43	most importantly we want to style our list so right here we can Target the UL	-
9:12:49	let's give it a list style to be equal to none to remove those bullet points	-
9:12:56	that didn't seem to do it yet but we can easily remove them on the list item as	-
9:13:01	well so we're gonna keep it for now then of course we want to change the	-
9:13:05	margin to be zero and padding to be zero and also let's change the height to be	-
9:13:11	100 as well as the width to 100 so now our UL list is taking the	-
9:13:18	entirety of this space let's make it a display is equal to flex	-
9:13:24	justify Dash content is equal to flex Dash start	-
9:13:29	align Dash items is equal to flex Dash start and finally Flex test direction is	-
9:13:36	set to column I'm gonna reload the page click this button right here	-
9:13:42	and all of our content is still on the bottom right	-
9:13:46	finally let's transition to changing the LI right here	-
9:13:51	let's set the margin to be equal to one REM on every single item	-
9:13:57	and it looks like to me that these styles are not getting applied	-
9:14:02	so what I'm gonna do is go back in here and look into here	-
9:14:09	it looks like we're missing this UL right here and that's the reason why the	-
9:14:14	Styles haven't been applying so what we need to do is simply copy this entire ul	-
9:14:20	and wrap our allies with it that was a rookie mistake on my end so let's simply	-
9:14:26	wrap everything with a ul and in this case we don't need our class name let's	-
9:14:32	save it and there we go this is looking so much better I was wondering why this	-
9:14:37	tiles haven't been applying but that is now fixed	-
9:14:41	inside of our Li we're going to have an a element which is an anchor tag so we	-
9:14:47	can simply set the color of that anchor tag to be VAR and then that's going to	-
9:14:52	be gray color so right here gray there we go of course we want to remove that	-
9:14:59	ugly text decoration which is going to be set to none font size is going to be	-
9:15:04	set to 1 Ram text Dash transform is going to be set to uppercase there we go	-
9:15:11	and find Dash weight is going to be set to 500. again we can copy the transition	-
9:15:16	we had above so let's find our transition	
9:15:20	there we go as well as the hover we can go down and paste that transition right	-
9:15:27	here inside of our anchor element alongside the hover let's save it and	-
9:15:33	now this is going to slowly turn into blue great these are the best	-
9:15:39	Transitions and animations when you can barely notice them but they are there	-
9:15:43	and they improve the quality of your software now we want to go all the way	-
9:15:47	out to this div let's see where is it ending	
9:15:52	so it's ending right here on this purple tag in my case and we want to add a	-
9:15:58	media query right above it so there is going to be a media query media screen	-
9:16:04	and we also want to add Min width	
9:16:09	in this case so let's change this to Min width which is going to be set to 900	-
9:16:16	pixels there we simply want to set the display to be equal to none this way if	-
9:16:23	we expand this over 900 pixels this is going to completely disappear	-
9:16:29	and of course we have to repeat the procedure with our entire menu app not	-
9:16:35	Bar menu so we can simply copy this and paste it here as well that's going to	-
9:16:40	remove that icon now we have just the menu for the	-
9:16:45	desktop devices and if we do this a new menu is going to appear that is	-
9:16:52	beautiful and with that we're done with the styles for our mobile menu	-
9:16:57	now let's expand this to the full browser size full HD and it's looking	-
9:17:03	glorious it's looking great we have our name our logo on the top left and also	-
9:17:10	we have our links in the middle now if we right click and click inspect	-
9:17:15	right now I'm testing on iPhone 12 Pro you can see that this is looking great	-
9:17:19	as well our menu blurs everything that's been needed this is going to be moved	-
9:17:24	down later on and we have this nice hamburger menu that when you click it	-
9:17:29	shows a great mobile menu with this clean background with the circles	-
9:17:34	looking great and we are ready to start coding our main hero section let's get	-
9:17:41	started right away by collapsing this a bit closing our navigation bar and then	-
9:17:47	collapsing everything going to front-end Source app and then you can simply	-
9:17:53	control click header this is going to be the section that we're going to	-
9:17:57	implement next so let's close this as well and prepare everything for our next	-
9:18:02	section to start with our header here we can	
9:18:06	first import motion from framer Dash motion because we're	-
9:18:12	going to animate it and then we also want to import some	-
9:18:16	images so right here we can say import images which is going to be coming from	-
9:18:21	dot dot slash dot slash constants our header CSS is already imported	-
9:18:29	so we can start with the div wrapping our entire header or a hero component	-
9:18:34	however you want to call it in here our div is going to have a class	-
9:18:40	name equal to app underscore underscore header and also app underscore	-
9:18:45	underscore Flex inside of there we're going to have an	-
9:18:48	animated motion dot div and that div is going to have a few	-
9:18:55	animation properties such as while in view	-
9:19:00	there we want to give it an X property which is equal to	-
9:19:05	-100 and 0 meaning that it's going to animate from the minus value you're	-
9:19:11	going to see it in action really soon and then we also want to change the	-
9:19:15	opacity of the animation so it's going to animate from 0 to 1 meaning from	-
9:19:21	fully invisible to fully visible just below that we're going to have our	-
9:19:26	transition which is going to be equal to duration of 0.5 seconds	-
9:19:32	and finally the class name is going to be set to app underscore underscore	-
9:19:37	header Dash info inside of our motion div we're going to have a normal div	-
9:19:43	and this div is going to have a class name	
9:19:48	equal to app underscore underscore header Dash batch	-
9:19:53	inside of there we can have one more div which is going to have a class name	-
9:19:58	equal to batch Dash CMP and also app underscore	-
9:20:05	underscore Flex inside of there we're gonna have a	-
9:20:09	friendly span which is simply going to have a wave Emoji so we can simply	-
9:20:14	Google for wave emoji and right here you can slowly copy it	-
9:20:21	and paste it right into here there we go	-
9:20:26	below that friendly wave Emoji we can have a div that's going to have a style	-
9:20:32	an inline style equal to margin left is 20.	
9:20:38	and inside of there we can have our P tag for paragraph	-
9:20:43	that's simply going to say hello I am	-
9:20:48	let's also give it a class name equal to B Dash text and just below that	-
9:20:56	we can have an H1 element that's going to have a class name equal	-
9:21:02	to head Dash text and it can say your name so let's stay consistent and use	-
9:21:09	Mikhail right here of course you can definitely put your own name right here	-
9:21:14	that's the whole reason why you're doing this and we can still see that that is	-
9:21:19	happening but our header is still below our navigation bar of course we're going	-
9:21:24	to fix this as soon as we add Styles but for now just so we can see what we're	-
9:21:29	doing you can go to app and simply comment out the navigation bar and there	-
9:21:34	we go now you can see your name here and if you reload you can see that it	-
9:21:40	animates from -1 pixels see that from the left to the right and the opacity	-
9:21:45	also changes from zero to one but it is incredibly quick 0.5 seconds if you	-
9:21:52	increase this to like 5 reload you can notice how slowly it	-
9:21:57	moves 100 pixels and changes the opacity framer motion is really powerful and	-
9:22:03	quite intuitive now below not this div but rather this entire batch div we're	-
9:22:09	going to have one more div this div is going to have a class name	-
9:22:14	equal to badge tag CMP and also app underscore	-
9:22:21	underscore Flex there we want to have two different paragraphs so we can copy	-
9:22:26	this one and paste it two times they're both going to be P text but in here we	-
9:22:31	can say what are we doing let's say that you are a web developer	-
9:22:36	and also right here you can say freelancer or maybe you do UI ux design	-
9:22:42	as well so you can put that here or whatever else explains what you best do	-
9:22:47	there we go of course it's not looking great at the moment because we haven't	-
9:22:52	added any Styles now below this motion div we're going to create two more	-
9:22:57	motion divs so motion dot div and we can already	-
9:23:02	copy it and leave some space for the next one inside of this second motion	-
9:23:07	div we're gonna also add some properties here and we can copy these three that we	-
9:23:12	already have there we go paste them right here of course they're not going	-
9:23:16	to be the same for the second one we just want to change the opacity it can	-
9:23:21	also be the duration of 0.5 seconds and we can also specify a new property delay	-
9:23:27	children so we're gonna delay the display of	
9:23:31	children for 0.5 seconds so first this div is going to happen and only then are	-
9:23:37	the elements inside of it going to start showing up	-
9:23:40	and the class name is not going to be header info it's going to be header IMG	-
9:23:45	so inside of there we just want to have one IMG tag and it's going to have a	-
9:23:51	source equal to images dot profile and ALT tag is going to be profile Dash VG	-
9:23:59	there we go our huge Mikhail is right here and now you can notice that this is	-
9:24:04	going to look a bit empty there's just a gray background all around our Michael	-
9:24:09	but what we can do is we can add a new background right there and that	-
9:24:14	background is going to be a motion dot IMG so this is the first time that we're	-
9:24:20	animating an image instead of a div but you can definitely do that you can	-
9:24:25	animate any element you'd like and right here we also need to have these three	-
9:24:30	properties but in this case we're not going to change the opacity rather we're	-
9:24:35	going to change the scale the duration is going to be one second	-
9:24:41	and the ease can be set to ease in out this simply signifies how	-
9:24:49	the animation is going to play out is going to be faster at the start or is it	-
9:24:54	going to be faster at the end of course we need to provide all other basic image	-
9:24:59	properties like Source images dot Circle and also we can provide the alt tag	-
9:25:06	which is going to be profile Dash underscore Circle and finally class name	-
9:25:12	is going to be overlay underscore Circle we can delete this class name from	-
9:25:18	before right here if you reload the page and scroll down you can see this big	-
9:25:23	circle appear of course with styling we're going to make that Circle appear	-
9:25:27	behind Michael so the last thing we have to do is implement the last motion div	-
9:25:33	this motion image is going to be a self-closing tag you can also do that	-
9:25:37	using framework motion so we don't need this and we can space this out properly	-
9:25:42	great so our last motion div is going to have variance	-
9:25:48	and in here we can provide different variants on how we want to scale	-
9:25:53	different elements inside of this div this variant is going to have a few	-
9:25:57	properties so we can name it something something like scale variance and then	-
9:26:03	we can declare it at the top above our component const scale variance is equal	-
9:26:10	to an object where while in view	-
9:26:15	then we can provide specific properties and that's going to be an object of	-
9:26:20	course in here we don't have an equal sign that's going to be a colon we want	-
9:26:25	to change the scale from 0 to 1. we also want to change the opacity from 0 to 1.	-
9:26:33	we also want to add transition which is going to be an object that's going to	-
9:26:37	have a duration equal to one and the ease is going to be set to ease	-
9:26:44	in out like that	-
9:26:47	we added quite a lot of properties to make this animation even better now we	-
9:26:52	can copy scale variants and put it right here under variant we also want to have	-
9:26:57	while in View and that is going to be equal to	-
9:27:02	kale variance dot while in view	-
9:27:08	finally we need a class name which is going to be simply app	-
9:27:14	underscore underscore header Dash circles	
9:27:17	and what are we going to put inside of this div well remember those little	-
9:27:22	floating bubbles appearing behind Michael that have images of different	-
9:27:27	Technologies well that's exactly what we're doing so we can open a dynamic	-
9:27:33	block of code have an array images dot flutter images dot Redux and images dot	-
9:27:41	SAS then we can simply call the dot map get an individual Circle as well as the	-
9:27:48	index and then we can instantly return something	
9:27:51	and that's something that we're going to return is going to be a div that's going	-
9:27:56	to have a class name equal to Circle Dash CMP app underscore underscore Flex	-
9:28:04	and it's going to have a key of course because we're mapping over elements	-
9:28:09	that's going to say Circle Dash and then index and inside of there we can render	-
9:28:14	an image that's going to have a source equal to Circle and an ALT which is	-
9:28:20	going to be equal to Let's simply say Circle there we go let's save it now	-
9:28:26	let's see if we can see some circles around here	-
9:28:29	nope they just quickly Flash and then they are gone so of course we'll have to	-
9:28:34	modify this with Styles but that's good because now we implemented the entirety	-
9:28:40	of our header and now we can focus on adding the styles to open up the Styles	-
9:28:45	just go to header and then header.scss inside of here since we're	-
9:28:52	working on a main section that we want to be able to scroll to we're going to	-
9:28:56	give it an ID of home and that's how we're going to style it of course our	-
9:29:01	header right now doesn't have that ID so let's provide ID equal to home inside of	-
9:29:08	our home we want to have the position is equal to relative	-
9:29:13	then we want to give it a background as well not a background color just a	-
9:29:18	background that's going to be a URL and that's going to be dot slash dot	-
9:29:24	slash assets forward slash BG IMG dot BNG that just added another Circle right	-
9:29:34	here but it's going to look so much better once we actually add all the	-
9:29:38	Styles and if we expand this we can barely see these big icons right here	-
9:29:43	don't worry about all of this mess these circles icons and our happy Michael	-
9:29:49	because we are going to style all of this right away so let's get to it let's	-
9:29:56	change the background Dash size to be equal to cover and this is something	-
9:30:01	they're going to always do whenever you're using an image as a background	-
9:30:05	then we want to set the background Dash repeat	
9:30:09	to repeat as well as background Dash position to be equal to Center then we	-
9:30:19	want to disable the padding to do dot app underscore underscore wrapper	-
9:30:24	padding is going to be set to zero and also later on we're going to add a	-
9:30:29	copyright so right now we can immediately set a display is equal to	-
9:30:35	none right here now let's start styling our app header so just below this home	-
9:30:41	we're going to do the dot app underscore underscore header and we're going to set	-
9:30:47	the flex to be equal to 1. then we want to change the width to be	-
9:30:52	equal to 100 percent as well as the height to be equal to one hundred	-
9:30:57	percent because we want our main section to take the entirety of the page	-
9:31:02	then finally Flex Dash direction is going to be set to row we want to set	-
9:31:08	this explicitly here because we can change it later on depending if we are	-
9:31:12	on mobile or desktop device let's provide some paddings like six Ram	-
9:31:17	2 RAM and then zero there we go that provided some space for the navigation	-
9:31:23	bar so I think we should be able to bring it back right now there we go this	-
9:31:28	is already looking like something well who am I lying it's still looking really	-
9:31:33	really bad but let's continue so right here we're going to add some media	-
9:31:38	queries because this is not going to look good	
9:31:41	on all devices right out of the box at media screen and Min Dash width 2000	-
9:31:49	pixels so this is going to be for incredibly large devices padding top is	-
9:31:55	going to be a ram now we can duplicate this two more times	-
9:32:00	and for the second one we're gonna have Max width	-
9:32:05	so if the maximum width is up to 1 200 pixels in that case we want to change	-
9:32:11	the flex Dash direction to be equal to column that means for mobile and tablet	-
9:32:17	devices as you can see right here but if we expand to desktop then this goes in a	-
9:32:23	row great so let's go back and the last one	
9:32:28	is going to be purely for mobile devices where Max width	-
9:32:33	is going to be 400 pixels and there we just want to reset the padding	-
9:32:38	so padding is going to be 6 Ram 1 RAM and two Ram so if we collapse this you	-
9:32:45	can see that it's looking kinda okay on mobile but that's going to be fixed	-
9:32:50	really soon so now we can focus on the header info which is this part right	-
9:32:54	here so that's going to be dot app underscore underscore header Dash info	-
9:33:00	we can set the flex to be equal to 0.65 because we want this to take about 65	-
9:33:07	percent of the screen then display is going to be set to flex Flex Dash	-
9:33:12	direction is going to be set to column justify Dash content is going to be set	-
9:33:18	to flex Dash start align Dash items is going to be set to flex Dash start as	-
9:33:25	well and finally height is going to be set to	
9:33:29	100 add media screen and in this case we	
9:33:35	want to have Max width of 2000 so this is for extra large devices there we're	-
9:33:42	gonna put the width of 100 as well and set the margin Dash right to be equal to	-
9:33:48	zero Ram there we go now we can see that this	-
9:33:52	comes right here now we want to change the header batch so let's go down that	-
9:33:57	app underscore underscore header Dash badge let's give it a width of 100	-
9:34:04	percent let's make display equal to flex justify	
9:34:09	Dash content to flex Dash end	-
9:34:14	as well as the Align Dash items to flex Dash and	-
9:34:18	and finally we want to make it Flex Dash direction is equal to column	-
9:34:25	there we go now we want to change the badges so specifically we can say dot	-
9:34:30	badge Dash CMP and then comma dot tag CMP so	
9:34:37	we're changing both of these tags at the same time padding one ram on top and	-
9:34:42	bottom and two RAM on left and right there we go let's also give it a border	-
9:34:49	so border is going to be VAR dash dash white Dash color	-
9:34:56	okay we cannot see it yet let's scroll down	
9:35:00	nope nothing to see here but just a few more properties and we'll	-
9:35:05	be able to see the changes border Dash radius is going to be 15 pixels	-
9:35:11	Flex Dash direction is going to be set to row width is going to be set to auto	-
9:35:18	and finally box Shadow which is going to give it that floating effect is going to	-
9:35:23	be set to 0 0 20 20 pixels and then the color is going to be rgba 0 0 0 which is	-
9:35:32	black and then 0.1 there we go now we can see this kind of 3D illusion and	-
9:35:38	this element is popping up in the air now let's specifically Target the tag so	-
9:35:44	we can copy this and paste it below dot tag CMP and let's change the flex Dash	-
9:35:51	direction to be equal to column there we go also margin Dash top is	-
9:35:58	going to be 3 RAM there we go so this is already looking	-
9:36:03	more like it we can also change the paragraph inside of there to give it a	-
9:36:08	width of 100 percent as well as the text Dash transform of	-
9:36:13	uppercase and finally text Dash align	
9:36:17	is going to be set to right there we go this is already looking much better now	-
9:36:23	below our tag we can Target the span element give it a font size of 2.5 Ram	-
9:36:32	there we go this just increase the size of our wavy icon and we can also add a	-
9:36:38	media query where media screen and in this case that's going to be Min width	-
9:36:44	is 2 000 pixels for extra large devices in that case we want to increase the	-
9:36:50	font size to 5 Ram to make it incredibly big	
9:36:54	we can go outside of our span element and add one final media query	-
9:37:00	media screen	
9:37:02	and Max width is going to be 1 200 pixels so if it's above the tablet and	-
9:37:10	mobile size then we want to justify content to flex start	-
9:37:16	and also align Dash items to flex Dash start there we go so it's here right now	-
9:37:25	and as we expanded you'll see it comes down here but on tablet size which is	-
9:37:31	around here it looks like this finally we have to focus on this circle	-
9:37:36	as well as these icons which we're going to turn to circles as well so if we	-
9:37:42	scroll down just below our last curly brace we're going to add the dot app	-
9:37:47	underscore underscore header Dash circles we're going to change the flex	-
9:37:52	property to be 0.75 let's also change the display to be	-
9:37:58	equal to flex Flex Dash direction is going to be set to column	-
9:38:05	justify Dash content is going to be set to space evenly	-
9:38:09	align Dash items is going to be Flex Dash start we can also change the height	-
9:38:15	to be 100 and margin Dash left is going to be set	-
9:38:21	to 1 Ram the reason why I'm not showing you any	-
9:38:25	changes or saving this file is because this is still going to look bad until we	-
9:38:30	style these individual images and now is the time to do that we can	-
9:38:36	say div and give it a width of 100 pixels as	-
9:38:41	well as the height of 100 pixels then we can also give it a border Dash	-
9:38:48	radius 50 to make it a circle	
9:38:53	also background is going to be set to VAR dash dash	-
9:38:58	white Dash color and then finally that box Shadow which	-
9:39:03	we can simply copy from above there we go	-
9:39:08	paste it right inside of here and finally we have to change the image tag	-
9:39:13	to be with is 60 percent and also height is going to be 60 as	-
9:39:21	well and there we go we have these three nice circles with Technologies you're	-
9:39:26	proficient in I personally don't know flutter so I	-
9:39:30	would remove this but seems like Michael knows it of course you want to put your	-
9:39:35	own best Technologies right here so if you are a phenomenal react developer or	-
9:39:41	maybe react native whatever it is you're doing definitely put it here now we want	-
9:39:47	to make the circles just a bit different so that they're not boring so we can go	-
9:39:51	outside of this div and then say div	-
9:39:55	child and then we can say one so this is	
9:40:00	targeting the first child we can give it a width of a hundred	-
9:40:04	pixels and a height of a hundred pixels as well	
9:40:10	now we can duplicate this two more times Target the second child and let's say	-
9:40:17	that it's going to have a margin of 1.75 RAM and we're going to change the width	-
9:40:23	to be equal to 150 pixels and height to 150 as well	-
9:40:28	as you can see they're looking just a bit different now and let's say you're	-
9:40:33	not that good at SAS we can simply decrease the width and height of this to	-
9:40:39	70 pixels there we go	-
9:40:42	of course we want to change the end child to be equal to 3. and now you	-
9:40:48	became so much more creative because you don't have three of the same circles you	-
9:40:53	made them different sizes and actually position them differently so right now	-
9:40:58	you basically become a web designer Jokes Aside of course let's make this	-
9:41:03	mobile responsive as well so we can add a media query with screen and Min Dash	-
9:41:10	width is going to be 2 000 pixels in there we can basically copy all of	-
9:41:16	these three divs paste them here and then just make them a bit larger since	-
9:41:21	we're working with the really large devices	
9:41:24	let's do 400 for the first one let's do something like 170 for the second one	-
9:41:30	and we don't need this margin and finally let's do 200 for the third	-
9:41:36	one now if we increase this not sure if	
9:41:41	we'll be able to notice it but I think our circles just got a bit bigger it's	-
9:41:46	hard to say really so let's move this here and finally we	-
9:41:51	want to add one more media query add media screen Max Dash with 1200 pixels	-
9:41:59	in this case we want to change the width to be equal to 100 percent	-
9:42:05	Flex Dash direction to be set to row Flex Dash wrap to be set to wrap margin	-
9:42:11	Dash left to be set to zero and finally change the div	-
9:42:17	to have a margin of one ram there we go so now on smaller devices these circles	-
9:42:24	are going to appear let's say in a column below our Michael and on desktop	-
9:42:29	they're going to appear right next to him	
9:42:32	looking great so let's keep doing our styles to make it even better the last	-
9:42:38	thing we want to change is going to be the app header image so let's go back to	-
9:42:42	header CSS create that class right there	-
9:42:47	set a flex to be equal to one and the height to be equal to 100	-
9:42:52	percent we also want to make it a display Flex	
9:42:57	justify Dash content is flex Dash and align Dash items is flex Dash and as	-
9:43:05	well and position is going to be relative this is going to move our	-
9:43:10	Michael relatively to the left and let's also change the image the width to be	-
9:43:16	equal to 100 percent and object Dash fit is going to be contain it looks like to	-
9:43:23	me that the only thing we have to contain about Michael is his great smile	-
9:43:27	so if we save this yep that definitely did it let's also change the Z index to	-
9:43:33	1 and now of course we have to position him properly so let's just go below this	-
9:43:39	image that overlay underscore Circle position is going to be absolute and	-
9:43:46	here it is this circle is covering him so let's go ahead and set the left	-
9:43:52	to be zero right to be zero as well bottom is going	-
9:43:58	to be zero and Z Dash index is going to be zero now Michael is coming in front	-
9:44:05	of the circle really proudly finally let's change the width of the	-
9:44:10	circle to be one hundred percent and also the height to be ninety percent	-
9:44:15	there we go looking great finally on mobile devices we have to add	-
9:44:21	a media query media screen and Max width 1200 pixels in there we can set the	-
9:44:29	margin to be 2 RAM and then 0 on left and right right now this is looking like	-
9:44:34	a tablet size to me and it's looking great but if we expand it to its full	-
9:44:39	full HD Glory this is looking great this looks like he's really inviting hero	-
9:44:46	section and it looks like Michael know what he's doing he has his thumbs up and	-
9:44:51	he says I know flutter I know Redux and SAS and I am a web developer hire me you	-
9:44:58	can do the same after you finish this portfolio so now let's go ahead and	-
9:45:02	collapse this and go to our second section which is going to be our about	-
9:45:07	section in here you can really show what you're all about so the about section is	-
9:45:14	going to be next to start coding out our about section we can first import a few	-
9:45:19	things that we're going to use across this file so let's start with import	-
9:45:24	motion which is going to come from framer Dash motion	-
9:45:30	then we're gonna also need a few things from react and these are going to be the	-
9:45:35	most popular hooks use State and use effect	
9:45:41	there we go that's going to be it for now and then later on we're going to add	-
9:45:46	a few more things here but for now let's start focusing on the jsx	-
9:45:51	inside of here we're going to return an empty react fragment	-
9:45:56	just like this and then inside of there we first want	-
9:46:00	to have an H2 this H2 is going to have a class name equal to head Dash text	-
9:46:08	inside of there we can say something like I know that	-
9:46:14	and then in here we can create a span element so I know that let's space this	-
9:46:20	out properly there we go I know that and then inside of the span	-
9:46:26	we're gonna say good design and then outside we can say means and	-
9:46:32	then one more time inside of the span good business okay and we can put a	-
9:46:38	lowercase D on that let's see how does that look like already looks really good	-
9:46:43	but of course we want to space it out a bit so let's add a Break Tag after the	-
9:46:49	first span right here br there we go I know that good design	-
9:46:55	means good business that's looking good if we expand this side just a bit we can	-
9:47:02	see that the text is still a bit too close together so later on we're going	-
9:47:06	to provide some spacing in between the spans and the rest of the text but for	-
9:47:11	now let's focus on our about section So Below this H2 we're going to create a	-
9:47:17	div and this div is going to have a class name equal to app underscore	-
9:47:23	underscore profiles inside of here we want to dynamically	-
9:47:27	Loop over our about section so what we can do is at the top let's create a	-
9:47:33	const something like about which is going to be an array and more	-
9:47:38	specifically an array of objects where each about is going to have a title	-
9:47:43	something like web development then we can have a description	-
9:47:50	let's do something like I am a good web developer	
9:47:56	and then finally we're going to have something like an image URL	-
9:48:01	but for now we can leave that empty right here so let's put it as an empty	-
9:48:06	string and then we're going to have a few of these let's say web development	-
9:48:10	web design and we can also put UI ux here	
9:48:16	and the last one can be something like let's do web animations or of course you	-
9:48:23	could have put front end back end full stack or something like that of course	-
9:48:28	we have to provide commas at the end of each row	-
9:48:31	there we go and now we can Loop over our abouts so	-
9:48:36	right here about dot map we're gonna get an individual about and also an index	-
9:48:43	and we want to instantly return something and for each about we're gonna	-
9:48:48	return emotion.div we can expand this as it's	
9:48:53	going to have quite a few properties for example it's going to have a while	-
9:48:58	in view and it's going to have the opacity of	-
9:49:03	one then we can provide while hover	
9:49:07	in that case it's going to have a scale of 1.1 to make it just a bit bigger we	-
9:49:15	can also provide a transition which is going to last meaning duration 0.5	-
9:49:21	seconds and type is going to be tween of course if you're not sure what does	-
9:49:28	this mean as whenever you're using any kind of Library just make sure to Google	-
9:49:33	frame or motion documentation tween and now let's add a class name	-
9:49:40	which is going to be app underscore underscore profile Dash item	-
9:49:45	and finally we need to have a key which is going to be equal to about dot title	-
9:49:51	plus index inside of there we're going to render an	-
9:49:56	image so right here we can say IMG and then we're going to have a source	-
9:50:02	in this case the source is going to be about dot IMG URL	-
9:50:08	we also need to have an ALT tag which is going to be about dot title	-
9:50:14	below our image we're going to have two more things first of all an H2 element	-
9:50:20	with a class name equal to bold Dash text	
9:50:25	it's also going to have an inline style equal to margin top 20 pixels	-
9:50:32	and there we can render about dot title and finally we can duplicate this line	-
9:50:40	change this to a P tag change the class name to P Dash text and	-
9:50:46	the style to margin top 10 pixels and there we can render about dot	-
9:50:52	description let's save it	
9:50:55	and as you can see we have a few different sections that once you hover	-
9:51:00	over them they scale to 1.1 as indicated here	
9:51:04	and right now we don't have any images as the image URL string is currently	-
9:51:10	empty but as we Loop over the real items that's going to change just to be able	-
9:51:16	to properly test it out let's find a demo image URL	-
9:51:20	at the top we can import our images by saying import	-
9:51:25	images and that's going to be from dot slash dot slash constants	-
9:51:32	and I think our image is under about zero so let's do right here images dot	-
9:51:39	about zero one in here we can copy that	-
9:51:43	zero two zero three and finally images zero four now if we save that	-
9:51:52	this is looking kinda funky we of course have to modify the Styles so let's go	-
9:51:59	ahead and do that right away we can go to about Dot scss	-
9:52:05	first of all we can Target the dot app underscore underscore about	-
9:52:10	and there we can change the flex to be one	
9:52:14	change the width to be 100 and change the flex direction to be set	-
9:52:20	to column that's going to make the text appear above	-
9:52:25	then we can say dot app underscore underscore profiles	-
9:52:29	there we can again use display flex but this time we're going to justify the	-
9:52:35	content to be equal to Center and we're going to align the items to be	-
9:52:42	Flex stash start as you can see now the items are going in a row but this is	-
9:52:49	still far from good so let's add the flex Dash wrap to be	-
9:52:54	equal to wrap and finally margin Dash top is equal to 2 REM to divide it from	-
9:52:59	the title now we can start styling each individual	-
9:53:03	about item by saying dot app underscore underscore profile Dash item the width	-
9:53:10	of the item is going to be 190 pixels the display is going to be set to flex	-
9:53:18	justify Dash content is going to be Flex Dash start align Dash items is going to	-
9:53:24	be Flex Dash start as well and flex Dash direction is going to be set to column	-
9:53:31	finally each item is going to be divided with a margin of 2 RAM	-
9:53:37	and finally let's style these big ass images so image	-
9:53:43	width is a hundred percent and there we go	-
9:53:47	already looking so much better let's also give them a constant height by	-
9:53:53	saying the height is 170 pixels border Dash radius is going to be 15	-
9:53:59	pixels and finally object Dash fit is going to	
9:54:04	be set to cover that way images are not going to be	-
9:54:08	skewed and the last thing we have to do below	
9:54:11	this image is provide a media query so media screen and Min Dash width is going	-
9:54:19	to be 2 000 pixels so this is again for extra large devices there we're going to	-
9:54:25	increase the width to 370 pixels and also increase the margins to 2 RAM	-
9:54:33	on top at bottom and 4 RAM on left and right finally we can also change the	-
9:54:38	height of the image so let's copy this paste it inside of the query and the	-
9:54:44	only thing we're going to change is going to be the height to 320 pixels	-
9:54:50	now if we expand this you'll see that it looks great on all kinds of devices	-
9:54:56	there we go now to quickly fix our text spacing	-
9:55:00	right here we can go back to our about and we can put all of this in one line	-
9:55:07	just like this I know that and then there's a space here between the span	-
9:55:12	and then means also a space here between the span	-
9:55:17	and that's going to provide the spacing the reason it didn't work before is that	-
9:55:22	these were all new lines so the compiler doesn't really know where is the space	-
9:55:27	here it just cuts it off but if we do it like this it keeps track of all the	-
9:55:32	spaces great I know that good design means good business but in here if you	-
9:55:39	are a developer and we all are developers you can say good development	-
9:55:44	means good business that word is just a bit too big but on bigger devices it	-
9:55:51	shouldn't be any problem but if you want to be sure that it works on all devices	-
9:55:55	good Dev is going to be just fine or you can do something like good apps that's	-
9:56:01	also great so what exactly are we good at web	-
9:56:05	development web design UI ux web animations in here you can really do	-
9:56:10	whatever you'd like you can do front-end development	
9:56:15	that's one thing that you're really good at then you could put back-end	-
9:56:20	development or you could do something like specific Technologies so let's do	-
9:56:25	backend in here we can do something like burn stack right	-
9:56:30	there we go so this is something that you're completely free to change both	-
9:56:35	the titles as well as the descriptions but now comes the main part of our	-
9:56:40	application this is the first time that we'll actually want to modify something	-
9:56:46	from our portfolio so if we expand this right now you're going to notice that in	-
9:56:52	here we have four different images four different titles as well as four	-
9:56:58	different descriptions well they're all the same now but you'll want them to be	-
9:57:02	different so how can we actually modify this data	
9:57:07	using sanity CMS this is the moment you've been waiting for we need to	-
9:57:12	connect sanity to our react application and trust me it's going to be fairly	-
9:57:18	simple let's collapse this one more time and	
9:57:22	just to have a clean working environment I'm going to close all the files	-
9:57:27	collapse everything and you'll want to go to front and react	-
9:57:31	source and create a new file inside of the source directory called	-
9:57:37	client.js this is going to be the place where we're going to connect our sanity	-
9:57:43	client with our react application let's start by importing sanity	-
9:57:49	client from at sanity forward slash client	
9:57:54	as well as importing image URL Builder from sanity	-
9:58:01	image Dash URL in here we want to export const client is equal to sanity client	-
9:58:10	which we just imported and we want to call it as a function and	-
9:58:16	provide in an object as a parameter there we're going to need a few things	-
9:58:20	we're going to need a project ID then we're going to need a data set	-
9:58:26	let's leave that as an empty string for now we're gonna need the API version as	-
9:58:32	well we're going to also need use CDN is set	
9:58:36	to true and finally you're gonna need a token	-
9:58:41	so you might be wondering where are we going to get all of this info from	-
9:58:45	well don't you worry at all let's go ahead and open up our terminal	-
9:58:51	we can split it by using this button right here we can CD into backend	-
9:58:57	underscore sanity and we can run the command sanity manage this is going to	-
9:59:03	open up the sanity management tool and there we go one question answered	-
9:59:09	immediately project ID is right here so we can just copy it	-
9:59:14	then we're going to have our data set so if we go here you're going to notice	-
9:59:18	that right now we are in production so you can simply type production	-
9:59:23	next we're going to need the API version and for that just type 2022 0201	-
9:59:32	use CDN is already set to true and the last thing we need is going to be the	-
9:59:37	token and to find our token we can go to our	
9:59:42	website expand it a bit go to API under course Origins we first need to	-
9:59:49	add our localhost 3000 here and let's allow credentials and click	-
9:59:55	save then we need to add an API token	
10:00:00	in this case we can say just application token	
10:00:05	and we're going to give it editor permissions and click save now we're	-
10:00:10	gonna get the API key for this token and you can paste it right here	-
10:00:17	course to keep all of this data safe especially the token we can create a new	-
10:00:23	DOT EnV file right in the root of our front-end react so new file dot EnV and	-
10:00:31	then you can create two new variables react	
10:00:35	underscore app underscore sanity underscore project underscore ID and	-
10:00:43	then that's going to be the name of your sanity project ID	-
10:00:47	and then we can repeat the process for react	
10:00:51	app sanity token	
10:00:54	and that's going to be equal to this entire token right here	-
10:01:00	let's paste it and whenever you change the dot EnV we	-
10:01:04	have to reload your application so let's press Ctrl c y and then npm start one	-
10:01:10	more time in our client side to run our application again so that it can get	-
10:01:16	populated with these new variables the last thing you have to do is copy	-
10:01:22	these variable names and then in the client instead of the	-
10:01:26	project ID now we're going to use process.env dot react app sanity project	-
10:01:32	ID and here process.env dot react absanity	-
10:01:39	token great	
10:01:42	now we're successfully connected with the sanity client and what we have to do	-
10:01:47	is say const Builder is equal to image URL Builder and call it and pass in the	-
10:01:54	client this is going to be useful for our images	-
10:01:58	and lastly we have to say export const url4	
10:02:03	source and then we have to say Builder dot	
10:02:08	image and provide the source right here this is just some code that we always	-
10:02:13	write whenever you're working with images using sanity	-
10:02:17	but with that said that's it that's the entire setup now we can use this sanity	-
10:02:22	client to fetch real data from the sanity dashboard	-
10:02:27	let's go back to our source and then container and about	-
10:02:34	about.jsx instead of this boring static data right here we're going to use react	-
10:02:40	and Sanity to fetch real Dynamic data from a CMS the way in which you can do	-
10:02:46	that is just create a use State field so let's start with use State snippet	-
10:02:54	let's call it abouts and set about and at the start it's going to be set to an	-
10:03:00	empty array then we're going to have a use effect	-
10:03:06	we can use that use effect snippet remove everything from the middle and	-
10:03:12	remove everything from the dependency array because we only want to run this	-
10:03:17	use effect at the start once our component loads	-
10:03:21	instead of here we can write a query for fetching our about section	-
10:03:26	const query is equal to a string asterisk	
10:03:32	and then an array sign inside of there underscore type is	-
10:03:37	double equal to about	
10:03:39	wrapped in double quotes now that we have the query we can import	-
10:03:45	the client at the top by saying import url4	
10:03:51	as well as the client from dot slash dot slash client	-
10:03:58	and finally we can use client dot fetch pass in the query and then that's going	-
10:04:05	to return a promise so we can use a DOT then	
10:04:09	inside of the dot then we're gonna have our data and the only thing we have to	-
10:04:14	do is simply set about and populate it with data	-
10:04:20	of course we can also write this in one line because it's a simple one-liner so	-
10:04:26	it would be a shame not to and there we go now we're populating the data with	-
10:04:31	the real abouts so let's remove the static data	-
10:04:35	and now we're mapping over the dynamic abouts coming from the CMS so let's save	-
10:04:41	it reload the page and scroll down you're gonna notice that right now it is	-
10:04:47	completely empty but how can we populate it	
10:04:50	it is as simple as going to the backend side of our application and running	-
10:04:55	sanity start this is going to open up the sanity	-
10:05:00	Studio on localhost 3333 inside of there we can go to our	-
10:05:07	abouts and we can create our first about I'm gonna copy the data that I had in	-
10:05:12	the already deployed site so the title is going to be a front-end developer	-
10:05:18	a description is going to be something about passion for building beautiful and	-
10:05:22	functional websites and of course we have to drag and drop the image	-
10:05:27	so of course this is the place where you would upload some kind of graphic that	-
10:05:32	represents front-end developer or design or whatever other skill you use in this	-
10:05:38	case we can go to our file tree go to assets right click it and click reveal	-
10:05:44	in File Explorer this is going to open up our assets	-
10:05:49	and then inside of here I'm gonna simply drag and drop the about one	-
10:05:53	and there we go the last thing we have to do is just click publish	-
10:05:59	now if we go back to our react application and reload the page you	-
10:06:04	should be able to see a new card with all of the data appear right here it	-
10:06:09	looks like we have a minor image issue so let's go back to the code	-
10:06:14	and right here instead of the about dot image URL we have to use that sanity	-
10:06:19	provided function url4 about dot image URL	-
10:06:26	let's save it and just like that the image appeared isn't that crazy	-
10:06:32	now we can go back to the sanity studio and we can just keep adding our skills	-
10:06:38	so let's create a new document let's do something like web designer I	-
10:06:44	am a web designer with passion for creating beautiful websites great	-
10:06:49	I'm gonna pull the about 2 and click publish	-
10:06:55	and I wanted to Speed the video up at this process so you don't have to watch	-
10:06:59	me add new skills but this process is incredibly quick as you can see we can	-
10:07:06	just keep adding new skills new portfolio items new anything in a matter	-
10:07:12	of seconds and best of all is that you don't have to be a developer to be able	-
10:07:18	to update your own site so if you want to hand over this	-
10:07:23	portfolio to a non-developer person you'll be able to give this to them and	-
10:07:28	they'll be able to upload their own content to it	-
10:07:31	now if we go back and reload the page you can see these four cards right here	-
10:07:37	appear instantly again one of the major points here is that a non-developer or a	-
10:07:44	non-technical person can also update the site without knowledge of all of these	-
10:07:49	lines of code that we just wrote right so be that a portfolio or a landing page	-
10:07:55	for a business such as a pizza place or a coffee shop	-
10:07:59	they are gonna be nagging you constantly please change my hours I don't work from	-
10:08:04	nine to five anymore make it 10 to 5 for example and you would have to manually	-
10:08:09	go ahead change the hours in the code but if you give them a website using a	-
10:08:13	CMS then they can change the content and the data themselves so be smart give	-
10:08:20	them a CMS website so that you don't have to come back and re-edit everything	-
10:08:25	constantly with that said we've just implemented the first initial section as	-
10:08:31	well as the second section of course right now you can see that something is	-
10:08:36	just a bit off the second section is not taking 100 of the height of the screen	-
10:08:41	and the first one is not doing that as well	
10:08:45	so I'm gonna show you a trick and a really useful react development practice	-
10:08:50	which is the use of higher order components	
10:08:54	so let's go ahead and do that right now I'm gonna collapse this just a bit and	-
10:09:01	have our clean working environment on the left side we are ready to implement	-
10:09:06	this so-called higher order component alongside fixing the heights of our	-
10:09:13	sections we also have to add the social media icons at the bottom left of each	-
10:09:19	section so if we go to our finished react application you can notice that	-
10:09:24	right here we have our social media icons and the same situation is	-
10:09:28	happening right here also the copyright right here and the scrolling icons so we	-
10:09:36	are not going to implement all of these components every time for every single	-
10:09:42	section to fix the problem of reusing components	
10:09:46	creatively and professionally we're gonna use higher order components so	-
10:09:52	let's go back to our application and let's wrap all of our sections with a	-
10:09:57	react higher order component what we can do is go to Explorer front	-
10:10:04	and react source and then create one last folder called wrapper	-
10:10:11	inside of our wrapper we're gonna have one file called app wrap dot Js	-
10:10:21	inside of our app wrap we're going to run rafce	-
10:10:26	and we're going to import a few things from our components more specifically	-
10:10:31	navigation dots and social media	-
10:10:39	and that's going to be coming from dot slash components	-
10:10:43	of course we haven't yet created these two components so now might be the best	-
10:10:48	time to do it let's go to our components and then	-
10:10:53	right here in the root we're going to create a new file called social media	-
10:10:59	Dot jsx there we can also run rafce and we're	-
10:11:06	first going to import a few icons that we're going to use	-
10:11:09	BS Twitter and also BS Instagram and these are coming from react Dash	-
10:11:18	icons forward slash BS we can duplicate this line below and we're gonna also	-
10:11:25	import fa Facebook F and that is coming from react	-
10:11:30	Dash icons f a inside of here we're gonna have a div	-
10:11:36	and that div is going to have a class name	
10:11:40	equal to app underscore underscore social inside of there I'm gonna create	-
10:11:46	a div and this div is going to wrap the first	-
10:11:50	one of our icons which is going to be Twitter	
10:11:55	there we go and now we can just duplicate this two more times	-
10:11:59	we can render Facebook for the second one and we can render Instagram for the	-
10:12:05	third one and that's going to be all that there is	-
10:12:08	for our social media.jsx now let's also do the navigation dots	-
10:12:15	so to do them we can create a new component inside of the components	-
10:12:20	folder called navigation dots Dot jsx	-
10:12:25	it's again going to be an rafce react Arrow function expert component	-
10:12:31	and inside of here we're going to accept one prop which is going to be active	-
10:12:36	this is going to tell us on which section are we currently inside of here	-
10:12:41	we're going to have a div that's going to have a class name equal to	-
10:12:47	app underscore underscore navigation and in here we're going to have a	-
10:12:52	similar thing that we had in the navigation bar so let's go to navbar	-
10:12:57	and let's go ahead and copy this Dynamic thing inside of the toggle URL only the	-
10:13:03	lies and the content where we're mapping over all of our links	-
10:13:08	so let's copy it go back to navigation dots and paste it	-
10:13:13	right here let's indent this properly and now we're	-
10:13:17	gonna have to modify it just a bit home about work skills we are also missing	-
10:13:24	testimonials and finally contact there we're going to get each individual	-
10:13:30	item as well as the index and now instead of rendering the LI we're simply	-
10:13:37	going to render an anchor tag this anchor tag is going to have a few	-
10:13:42	properties so let's expand them each in its own line	-
10:13:46	there we go just like this and the href is going to remain the same we also need	-
10:13:52	to add a key which is going to be item plus index to make it unique we're gonna	-
10:13:58	also have a class name equal to app underscore underscore navigation Dash	-
10:14:04	Dot and finally we're going to have an inline Style	-
10:14:09	which is going to say if active is triple equal to the current item then	-
10:14:16	we want to have a background color equal to that's going to be hash three one	-
10:14:23	three BAC otherwise we can simply have an empty object	-
10:14:30	so this is going to be it and this anchor tag can be self-closing we don't	-
10:14:34	have to render anything inside of it so let's simply close it and that is	-
10:14:40	going to be it for our navigation dots now we can go back and continue where we	-
10:14:45	left off inside of our app wrap now we do have access to real navigation	-
10:14:51	dots and social media components and we can convert our app wrap into a higher	-
10:14:58	order component so our app wrap is going to accept a component with a Capital C	-
10:15:06	ID name as well as class names and it's going to return yet another	-
10:15:15	function which is going to be hoc higher order component	-
10:15:22	and then that component is going to return some content	-
10:15:26	it might be confusing now but it's going to make more sense as we keep writing it	-
10:15:31	so inside of here first of all we're going to give an ID to this div which is	-
10:15:37	going to be equal to ID name that's going to get passed through the prompts	-
10:15:41	it's also going to have a class name equal to a template string of app	-
10:15:47	underscore underscore container and then space	
10:15:51	class names so we can provide class names dynamically	-
10:15:56	inside of here we're going to render our social media	-
10:16:01	and then below we're gonna have a div this div is going to have a class name	-
10:16:08	equal to app underscore underscore wrapper and then app underscore	-
10:16:13	underscore Flex and then there we're going to render our	-
10:16:17	actual component which is going to be a specific section	-
10:16:22	so what we're doing right now is taking this entire section that you can see on	-
10:16:26	the right side and wrapping it with all of this code giving it an ID so that we	-
10:16:31	can scroll to it giving it some class names and giving it social media so it's	-
10:16:37	unwrapped in here we're gonna also give it a copyright so	-
10:16:42	we can say div that's going to have class name	-
10:16:46	equal to copyright and it's going to have two paragraphs	-
10:16:52	a paragraph is going to have a class name equal to p dash text and it's going	-
10:16:59	to say 2020 Michael	
10:17:03	and we can duplicate it one more time and say something like all rights	-
10:17:08	reserved not for you guys you can use this	
10:17:13	portfolio however you'd like and finally below this div not this one	-
10:17:19	but rather this one we're going to render our navigation dots	-
10:17:25	and we also need to provide an active which is going to be equal to ID name we	-
10:17:31	need to know on which section are we currently on	-
10:17:34	and that's it we are exporting default our app wrap but now let me show you how	-
10:17:41	you can use it let's go inside of our header which is	-
10:17:46	the first component or a container that we've created	-
10:17:50	and at the top let's import app wrap import app wrap	-
10:17:58	that's going to be from dot slash dot slash wrapper	-
10:18:04	but I don't think we've properly exported it yet as you can see so we	-
10:18:09	have to go back to wrapper and create an index.js file	-
10:18:15	inside of that index.js file we can do export	
10:18:20	in curly braces default as app wrap and then from dot slash app	-
10:18:28	wrap we're doing this because later on we're gonna have one more wrapper	-
10:18:34	so right now it looks like our issue is right here while we're trying to import	-
10:18:40	the components into the app wrap and that is because we haven't exported	-
10:18:45	these two components yet so inside of our components index.js we	-
10:18:51	can export default as and then that's going to be navigation	-
10:18:56	dots but just one time because we don't have	
10:19:00	to go into the inner folder and finally that's going to be social media there we	-
10:19:07	go now we have everything we need so let's go back to header and you might be	-
10:19:12	wondering how do we use this app wrap where do we put it how do we wrap our	-
10:19:18	header with it take a look at this before we export our	-
10:19:23	header we're just going to do one thing we're going to call our app wrap	-
10:19:28	component and pass the header as the first property and then we're gonna pass	-
10:19:34	home as the second one with this we no longer have to add the	-
10:19:39	ID of home to this div right here rather take a look what's happening	-
10:19:45	we are going into app wrap and we're passing in our entire header section as	-
10:19:52	our component and we're passing in the ID name so now if you reload the page	-
10:19:58	and expand it you can notice that we have our slider	-
10:20:03	on the right side and the social media icons on the left how cool is that but	-
10:20:10	if we scroll down you're gonna notice that the second section still doesn't	-
10:20:13	look good so imagine if we had to manually re-add all of these things that	-
10:20:19	wouldn't be good so what we can simply do is go into our second component which	-
10:20:26	is going to be about right here we can simply import our app wrap	-
10:20:32	so import app wrap from dot slash dot slash wrapper	-
10:20:39	we don't need these images anymore and now we can just repeat the process	-
10:20:44	export default we call the app wrap wrap the about and	-
10:20:50	then pass in the about as the ID where we want to scroll to and save it	-
10:20:57	now if we expand this you're going to notice that this section	-
10:21:02	now takes the full height of the screen has social media icons on the bottom	-
10:21:07	left and has the slider on the right and we can actually slide with the animation	-
10:21:13	from the first to the second section isn't this crazy	-
10:21:19	so alongside this video where you just wanted to learn how to do a portfolio	-
10:21:24	I've also taught you how to use higher order components to wrap your smaller	-
10:21:30	components that share similar functionalities you're welcome if you	-
10:21:35	like that definitely make sure to leave a like and comment down below that	-
10:21:39	you've came the higher order components part of the video I appreciate it with	-
10:21:45	that said our first two major sections as well as the navigation bar are	-
10:21:51	completely done now we're going to go to the next section which is going to be	-
10:21:56	your creative portfolio great let's collapse this just a bit	-
10:22:02	close all of the files and open up only the creative portfolio	-
10:22:09	that's going to be container and finally work	
10:22:13	there we go we can also see that we have four more	-
10:22:18	sections to do so work or portfolio section is next	-
10:22:23	to start with their work section we can first import all of the necessary	-
10:22:27	dependencies these are going to be use State as well as the use effect coming	-
10:22:34	from react then we're going to import some icons	-
10:22:38	import AI fill I as well as the AI fill GitHub	
10:22:46	and these are coming from react Dash icons forward slash AI	-
10:22:52	right below that we're gonna import Motion One More Time	-
10:22:57	which is coming from framer Dash motion then we're gonna also import	-
10:23:04	app wrap since now we have it so we can do that instantly	-
10:23:09	and we're gonna import that from dot slash dot slash wrapper	-
10:23:15	we can also import the URL for as well as the client from dot slash data slash	-
10:23:23	client because we now already have that as well and then finally we have our	-
10:23:29	scss file so now we can start coding out the works section which is actually the	-
10:23:35	creative portfolio so right here we don't need a div we can	-
10:23:40	just use a basic react fragment and then inside of here we're gonna have	-
10:23:45	an H2 this H2 is going to be similar to the	-
10:23:49	one we've had in the about section so we can go here and just copy this one	-
10:23:54	go back and then paste it instead of saying I know that good apps	-
10:24:00	mean good business we can say something like my creative and then space span	-
10:24:07	inside of there we can say portfolio and then outside of the span we can	-
10:24:14	simply say section of course you don't need to add that	-
10:24:18	section if you don't like to but it's looking good	-
10:24:21	so right below this H2 we're gonna have a Dev	-
10:24:26	and this div is going to have a class name equal to app underscore underscore	-
10:24:32	work dash filter there we can Loop over all of our	-
10:24:37	categories right now the categories are static so let's create an array UI ux	-
10:24:44	can be one category we can have web app as the second one then we're gonna have	-
10:24:50	mobile app as the third one and finally let's do react.js as well as all	-
10:24:59	and we can map over it by saying that map we're going to get each individual	-
10:25:04	item as well as the index and the question is what do we want to return	-
10:25:09	for each one of these items and that is going to be a div	-
10:25:15	more specifically a div that's going to have a key equal to index	-
10:25:21	it's also going to have an on click property which is going to call a	-
10:25:27	callback function handle work filter and we want to pass	-
10:25:33	in the item of course this is a function that we haven't yet created so right at	-
10:25:38	the top we can create the const handle work filter	-
10:25:43	which is going to accept the item these are going to be those little pills that	-
10:25:48	we can use to categorize our applications	
10:25:52	once we have the on click we can also add a class name	-
10:25:57	which is going to be a dynamic template string	
10:26:01	app underscore underscore work dash filter Dash item	-
10:26:06	space app underscore underscore flex and then space p dash text and then finally	-
10:26:14	dynamically if active filter is triple equal to item in that case we want to	-
10:26:21	add item Dash active else we simply want to add an empty	-
10:26:28	string now you might be wondering what is this active filter and that is going	-
10:26:33	to be our state so right at the top we can say use State snippet and that's	-
10:26:38	going to be active filter and at the start it can be set to all	-
10:26:46	great we are out of our error and we can continue creating our div	-
10:26:51	inside of this div we simply want to show an item	-
10:26:55	and there we go UI ux web these are all the categories of course it's not	-
10:27:02	looking good right now because we haven't yet implemented the Styles now	-
10:27:06	below this entiretive we're going to have a motion div motion dot div	-
10:27:14	that motion Dev is going to have the animate property equal to animate card	-
10:27:20	in that animate card is going to be yet another special state that we're going	-
10:27:26	to change so let's set the use State snippet to be equal to animate card	-
10:27:33	set animate card and at the start it's going to be set to an object containing	-
10:27:38	the Y property equal to zero and opacity equal to one but later on we're going to	-
10:27:45	move these around so that the elements in our list change then let's also add a	-
10:27:51	transition which is going to be equal to duration of 0.5 seconds	-
10:27:57	as well as delay children to 0.5 and finally let's also provide a	-
10:28:06	class name which is going to be equal to app underscore underscore work dash	-
10:28:11	portfolio there we go now inside of here we have	
10:28:16	to actually Loop over our portfolio items so it might be a good idea to	-
10:28:21	fetch them first and remember the fetching is going to be done through	-
10:28:26	sanity because we're working with real data so let's create a use effect right	-
10:28:31	here and that use effect is going to happen only at the start of our	-
10:28:36	application or at the render of our component	
10:28:39	and there we need to write a query const query is equal to a string	-
10:28:45	asterisk square brackets underscore type is equal to works	-
10:28:53	there we go and finally we have to say client dot fetch query	-
10:28:59	and then dot then once we get the data we want to set it so what we can do is	-
10:29:05	say set works is equal to data and also set filter work is equal to data there	-
10:29:13	we go and these are both going to be different	-
10:29:17	states so let's create those State fields	
10:29:20	use state Works which is going to be an empty	-
10:29:25	array at the start and also use state that's going to be filter work	-
10:29:35	there we go and that's also going to be empty at the start or an empty array	-
10:29:41	great so now we can actually map over that data right here we can open a	-
10:29:47	dynamic block of code and say filter work not map rather map and then right	-
10:29:54	here we can get the work and the index and for each one we want to return a Dev	-
10:30:00	that Dev is going to have a class name equal to app underscore underscore work	-
10:30:06	dash item and app underscore underscore flex and	-
10:30:11	of course the key is going to be index inside of there we want to have one more	-
10:30:16	div this div is going to have a class name	
10:30:20	equal to app underscore underscore work Dash IMG app underscore underscore flex	-
10:30:28	and inside of there we're gonna have our image so IMG	-
10:30:34	it's going to have a source or SRC equal to url4 and then we're gonna pass in the	-
10:30:41	work dot IMG URL and also all tag is going to be work dot name let's save	-
10:30:50	this and nothing should happen right away because we haven't yet populated	-
10:30:54	our sanity work section so if we go right here to contents and then works we	-
10:31:02	can add our first work so let's go ahead and create it	-
10:31:06	the title is going to be modern ux UI website description can be a modern UI	-
10:31:16	ux portfolio website in here you can put the link to your	-
10:31:22	project in this case we can already use this deployed one	-
10:31:26	and in here you can put the link to your code so that's going to be https colon	-
10:31:32	forward slash forward slash github.com and then something in this case let's	-
10:31:37	just leave it empty you can also provide the image so let's just use a random	-
10:31:42	image right here and finally you can add the tags	-
10:31:47	so in this case let's add a tag of UI ux and of course you can add multiple tags	-
10:31:55	so we can also add the alt tag and let's click publish so now if we go back to	-
10:32:01	our application and reload the page you can see that we have our first	-
10:32:07	project right here at least just the image so let's continue adding all of	-
10:32:12	the other project details below our image we're going to have a	-
10:32:17	motion div so motion dot div	-
10:32:21	we're going to expand it just a bit so right here we can say while hover	-
10:32:28	and then there we can provide the opacity to change from 0 to 1. then we	-
10:32:34	also want to apply a transition which is going to have a duration equal	-
10:32:40	to 0.25 and then the ease is going to be set to	-
10:32:45	ease in out and in this case we don't want to delay children we want to	-
10:32:52	stagger children this means that the elements are going	-
10:32:56	to show one after another and that's going to be by 0.5 seconds of	-
10:33:02	course we have to add a comma right here just below we also need to add a class	-
10:33:07	name equal to app underscore underscore work dash hover	-
10:33:12	app underscore underscore Flex and inside of that motion div we're	-
10:33:18	going to have an anchor tag so right here an anchor that anchor is going to	-
10:33:23	have an href equal to work dot project link	
10:33:28	and the target is going to be set to underscore blank	-
10:33:33	and whenever you have underscore blank it is preferred to have the Rel	-
10:33:38	equal to no referrer there we go so this anchor tag is going to wrap our first	-
10:33:43	icon which is going to be this eye right here so let's create one more motion div	-
10:33:49	inside of it motion that div and that motion div	-
10:33:54	is going to have similar properties to this one so we can copy them paste them	-
10:34:00	here while hover is going to have a scale property and it's going to scale	-
10:34:05	from 1 to 0.9 it's going to become smaller	
10:34:11	but we're going to scale it while in view	
10:34:16	and that's going to scale from 0 to 1. there we go transition is just going to	-
10:34:23	have a duration of zero point let's do 25 seconds and then finally the class	-
10:34:30	name is just going to be app underscore underscore flex and inside of there so	-
10:34:36	simple we're just gonna add our AI fill I icon that's it	-
10:34:43	let's go back and see if we can maybe spot it there we go it's barely visible	-
10:34:48	on the right side finally we can copy this entire anchor	-
10:34:53	tag and duplicate it just below because for the second time this is going to	-
10:34:58	point to the code link everything is going to remain the same	-
10:35:02	but now we're going to render the AI fill GitHub icon	-
10:35:08	there we go so now we have two icons somewhere on the side here	-
10:35:13	and finally below this anchor tag below the motion div and Below one more div	-
10:35:19	we're gonna have our final div that's going to contain the title and the	-
10:35:24	description of our project so that's going to be a div it's going	-
10:35:28	to have a class name equal to app underscore underscore work dash content	-
10:35:34	and also app underscore underscore Flex so that we can Center everything	-
10:35:39	there we're going to have an H4 that's going to have a class name equal to bold	-
10:35:45	Dash text and there we can render the work dot title below that we're gonna	-
10:35:52	also have a v tag it's going to have a class name equal to p dash text and it's	-
10:35:59	also going to have an inline style of margin top is equal to 10.	-
10:36:04	and there we can render the work dot description there we go if we save that	-
10:36:10	we can see our modern UI ux website in the description right here	-
10:36:15	finally we're going to also render the tags so while still being inside of this	-
10:36:21	div we're gonna add one div that's going to have a class name equal to app	-
10:36:28	underscore underscore work Dash tag and also app underscore	-
10:36:33	underscore Flex there we simply want to render 1p tag	-
10:36:37	that's going to have a class name equal to p dash text and there we're	-
10:36:44	simply going to say work dot tags and render the first tag on the list	-
10:36:50	there we go UI ux of course this is looking awful right now but remember the	-
10:36:58	end product is this a nice list of appearing elements that all represent	-
10:37:04	different projects in your portfolio that's going to be it for the jsx but	-
10:37:09	let's not forget to wrap our work into app wrap that's a funny name and also we	-
10:37:17	have to provide the second parameter which is the ID work	-
10:37:22	there we go so now we've coded most of the work section of course we are yet to	-
10:37:28	handle the filters but let's first apply the Styles so that it looks like	-
10:37:33	something because right now this seems like the first project I've	-
10:37:38	ever done in HTML and CSS the image is too big and the flex is broken okay	-
10:37:43	let's go ahead and collapse this open up the works Dot scss and let's get to it	-
10:37:50	we're going to first Target the dot app underscore underscore works	-
10:37:56	that's our entire section which is going to have a flex equal to one	-
10:38:01	and also width is equal to one hundred percent and we are gonna also have a	-
10:38:07	flex Direction equal to column so that our title appears on top	-
10:38:13	then we're gonna Target the dot app underscore underscore Works Dash filter	-
10:38:18	and right here we're gonna change the display to be equal to flex Flex Dash	-
10:38:25	direction to be equal to rho justify Dash content to be equal to flex	-
10:38:31	Dash start align Dash items to be equal to Center	-
10:38:37	and flex Dash wrap to be equal to wrap there we go now we have all of these	-
10:38:45	elements let's also apply some margin	
10:38:48	like margin 4 REM 0 and then 2 RAM there we go	-
10:38:55	of course we have to make these look like pills like right here so we can do	-
10:39:01	that by styling each one of these individually so while still being inside	-
10:39:06	of this class we can say dot app underscore underscore work dash filter	-
10:39:11	Dash item let's give them padding of 0.5 RAM and 1 Ram	-
10:39:18	there we go to space them up a bit let's also give them a border Dash radius of	-
10:39:25	0.5 RAM and most importantly background Dash color is equal to FFF	-
10:39:34	there we go let's also change the color of the text to something like zero zero	-
10:39:39	zero with a hash at the start there we go and	
10:39:44	let's also change the font weight to be equal to 800.	-
10:39:50	we can also make them appear clickable by adding the cursor equal to pointer	-
10:39:56	as well as the transition all 0.3 seconds and ease	-
10:40:03	we can also provide the margin equal to 0.5 RAM on all sides	-
10:40:09	there we go so now the transition is going to happen	-
10:40:12	once we actually hover over the elements so we can say dollar sign colon hover	-
10:40:19	background Dash color is VAR dash dash secondary	
10:40:26	Dash color okay right here I use the dollar sign looks like I've been using	-
10:40:31	some PHP lately but this was supposed to be an end sign so let's quickly fix that	-
10:40:38	and now this is going to animate slowly but of course we also have to change the	-
10:40:43	color to be equal to FFF there we go looking so much better already let's	-
10:40:50	also add a media query just below at media screen	-
10:40:56	and that's going to be min	
10:41:00	Dash width is 2000 pixels there we want to just increase the	-
10:41:06	padding a bit by saying padding one ram and also 2 RAM and also increase the	-
10:41:12	Border radius so border radius is going to be 0.85 Ram	-
10:41:18	there we go again not visible here but on larger devices it's definitely	-
10:41:24	visible now outside of our app work filter item	
10:41:29	right here we can also Target the that item Dash active and give it a	-
10:41:35	background color equals the same one that we're hovering so right here simply	-
10:41:40	paste this here there we go so now we know that all is	-
10:41:45	currently active and we can select a different one	-
10:41:48	thankfully now is the time that we're going to focus on our portfolio and	-
10:41:52	decreasing the size of this image so let's go down a bit and let's start	-
10:41:56	get the dot app underscore underscore work dash portfolio	-
10:42:01	there we can set the display to be equal to flex Flex Dash wrap to be equal to	-
10:42:07	wrap justify Dash content to be equal to	
10:42:11	Center and align Dash items to be equal to	
10:42:16	Center as well this is not going to trigger any changes	-
10:42:20	because we are yet to decrease the width of this image	-
10:42:24	so now we can Target the individual that app underscore underscore work dash item	-
10:42:29	and give it a width of 270 pixels there we go now we can see our slider	-
10:42:36	right here let's also change the flex Dash direction to be set to column give	-
10:42:42	it a margin of 2 RAM padding of one ram	-
10:42:47	border Dash radius of 0.5 Ram a background color equal to White	-
10:42:55	and color equal to Black of course the image is still taking over	-
10:43:02	but trust me we're going to fix that really soon or you know what let's fix	-
10:43:07	it immediately it's really triggering me so let's go to dot app underscore	-
10:43:12	underscore work dash IMG let's change the width to a hundred	-
10:43:18	percent and let's change the height to be equal	
10:43:22	to 230 pixels then we're going to make the position be	-
10:43:29	a relative and most importantly we can change the	-
10:43:32	IMG tag to have a width of a hundred percent and also a height of a hundred	-
10:43:39	percent so now it's properly fitted here we can also give it a border Dash radius	-
10:43:45	of 0.5 RAM and object Dash fit is going to be cover	-
10:43:52	there we go looking so much better also on big devices we want to increase the	-
10:43:58	height a bit so we can say add media screen and Min Dash with 2000 pixels we	-
10:44:06	want to take this height and increase it to 350 pixels so now our image is proper	-
10:44:12	and we can continue with our app work item more specifically we need to make	-
10:44:18	it a cursor Dash pointer so now we're going to have	-
10:44:23	a pointer we can copy the transition from above this one right here and paste	-
10:44:30	it below our cursor pointer finally we want to add the hover effect so we can	-
10:44:36	say and hover box Shadow is going to be 0 0 25 pixels rgba zero zero zero zero	-
10:44:47	point two so now if we hover you can notice the	-
10:44:51	shadow up here right behind it and finally we just want to add two more	-
10:44:57	media queries this is the first one so we can copy it	-
10:45:01	place it just below our hover the Min width is going to be 2000 pixels	-
10:45:06	and in here we're gonna change the width to 470 pixels	-
10:45:12	also padding to be 1.25 RAM and Border Dash radius is going to be 0.75 Ram	-
10:45:22	and let's also add one media query for smaller devices where the max width is	-
10:45:28	going to be only 300 pixels there we can simply say width is 100 and	-
10:45:35	also margin is equal to one REM there we go so this is already looking	-
10:45:42	so much better as you can see right here but now we also have to fix these icons	-
10:45:48	right here if you can see them we have two icons that are right now to the	-
10:45:53	right of the image instead of over the image so let's Implement that hover	-
10:45:58	effect below our image	
10:46:01	we can Target that app underscore underscore work dash hover	-
10:46:06	position is going to be set to Absolute that's already going to position it	-
10:46:12	the top is going to be set to zero left is going to be set to zero bottom zero	-
10:46:19	as well as the right zero as well and the width is going to be 100 percent	-
10:46:26	if we fix this and also the height is going to be 100 percent	-
10:46:32	most importantly the background Dash color is going to be rgba	-
10:46:37	zero zero zero zero point five so now if we hover you can see this nice	-
10:46:45	hover right here over the image let's also give it a border Dash radius	-
10:46:52	of 0.5 Ram okay already better and also opacity	
10:46:58	zero as well as the transition all 0.3 seconds ease and now we have to	-
10:47:07	Target the div that's inside and finally the icons so let's start with the div	-
10:47:13	that div is going to have a width of 50 pixels	
10:47:17	a height of 50 pixels as well it's going to have a border Dash radius of 50 to	-
10:47:25	make it a circle as well as the background Dash color of	-
10:47:30	RGB a 0 0 0 0 0.5 okay we already have those circles right now and let's change	-
10:47:39	the color to be equal to White so that's going to be hash FFF let's divide them a	-
10:47:47	bit by giving them margin equal to one fan Dash family	-
10:47:53	is going to be set to VAR dash dash font Dash base	-
10:48:00	and font weight is going to be set to 800.	
10:48:04	of course let's give them a cursor equal to pointer	-
10:48:08	as well as this transition that we're going to copy from here last thing is to	-
10:48:13	Target the svgs directly give them a width of 50 percent the height of 50	-
10:48:20	percent as well as change the color to be equal to VAR	-
10:48:26	and then that's going to be not font base but rather white Dash color	-
10:48:33	and there we go these icons are looking amazing and these animations look	-
10:48:40	playful as well finally the simpler thing of all of this	-
10:48:44	is going to be the bottom content section for the title and the	-
10:48:48	description so let's just scroll down and Target the	
10:48:52	dot app underscore underscore work dash content let's give it a bit of padding	-
10:48:57	like 0.5 Ram Also let's set the width	-
10:49:03	to be equal to 100 percent position to be set to relative and flex	-
10:49:10	Dash direction to be set to column there we go already looking much better	-
10:49:18	we can Target the H1 inside of this by giving it a margin top is equal to	-
10:49:24	one REM and also line Dash height is equal to 1.5	-
10:49:30	the last thing we have to do is still inside of the app or content Target the	-
10:49:36	dot app underscore underscore work dash tag	
10:49:40	let's give it a position equal to Absolute	
10:49:44	let's apply padding equal to 0.5 RAM and one ram on left and right let's give it	-
10:49:50	a border Dash radius of 10 pixels a background Dash color of FFF	-
10:49:59	and a Top Value equal to minus 25 pixels there we go so now it looks like it's	-
10:50:07	coming outside of this white piece and it's telling us that this project is in	-
10:50:12	the UI ux category and it provides this clean look where when we hover you can	-
10:50:19	see that this box darkens but this pill Remains the Same so that's looking great	-
10:50:26	but of course we don't want to have just one project so let's add the second one	-
10:50:30	let's go to our content works and quickly add another	-
10:50:36	let's do something like a Garrick restaurant project if you watch the	-
10:50:43	JavaScript Master YouTube channel then you know that this is another modern UI	-
10:50:49	ux project the project link is going to be well	-
10:50:53	let's put it blank for now same for the code link and let's upload a random	-
10:50:58	image the tag can be this time all	
10:51:03	as well as the UI ux there we go and let's publish it	-
10:51:10	let's also add one more project of a different category so that we know if	-
10:51:14	that works let's go ahead and say react application	-
10:51:19	or let's see what categories do we have mobile app okay	-
10:51:23	so right here we can say cool mobile	
10:51:27	app description is going to be	
10:51:30	Tinder clone	
10:51:34	in react native project link is going to be nothing code	-
10:51:39	link nothing let's pull up the Project image	
10:51:43	and put the tags as mobile app as well as the all and let's publish it now if	-
10:51:52	we go back to our application and reload the page	-
10:51:56	just like that we can scroll to our third section which is our creative	-
10:52:00	portfolio and we have our three projects with great titles and descriptions also	-
10:52:08	we can hover over them and we can see what this project really is about if we	-
10:52:12	go to the deployed link or visit a GitHub repository again you can	-
10:52:18	dynamically add or remove projects from here that's great the last thing we	-
10:52:23	haven't done with this section is implementing the filtering right now	-
10:52:27	this doesn't do anything so let's go back to our	-
10:52:32	works.jsx and let's fix the handle work filter to make the handle work filter	-
10:52:38	work we'll have to set the active filter to be equal to item	-
10:52:43	we can also set the animate card to be equal to an array where Y is set	-
10:52:50	to 100 and opacity is set to zero this is going to re-trigger the shuffle	-
10:52:57	animation of the cards once we change the category	-
10:53:01	let's add a set timeout right here we can use this set timeout function	-
10:53:08	timeout accepts a number in milliseconds like 500	-
10:53:13	and there we can recall the set animate cards and reset it back to Y is 0 and	-
10:53:21	opacity is 1. so this is going to re-trigger the	-
10:53:25	animation finally in the set timeout we can say if	
10:53:29	item is equal to all in that case we want to set filter work	-
10:53:38	to be equal to works and else we want to	-
10:53:43	set Filter Works to be equal to works.filter	
10:53:50	where we get individual work and we only want to keep it if	-
10:53:56	work.tags dot includes the item looks like I have a typo here so set	-
10:54:03	filter work let's go back expand it and let's go to	-
10:54:09	reaction yes there's nothing there mobile app and there is our mobile	-
10:54:14	application and if we go to UI ux there should be two applications which you saw	-
10:54:21	slide nicely from the bottom to the top this is looking great should I even be	-
10:54:28	amazed about the project I've created that might not be normal but I think	-
10:54:33	we're all happy from time to time when we create a cool project and I'm even	-
10:54:37	happier because I'm sharing this project with you	-
10:54:41	one thing I am even more excited about that soon enough once I release the	-
10:54:46	JavaScript Mastery Pro platform I'll be able to share even better projects with	-
10:54:51	you this movie application is just one example where you can learn to code	-
10:54:57	professionally and confidently so this is coming soon enough if you want to	-
10:55:02	stay up to date with the release there's going to be a newsletter Link in the	-
10:55:06	description so make sure to sign up and wait for the updates	-
10:55:11	I just wanted to share that with you because I'm quite excited	-
10:55:15	so now we can go back to replication take a look at all of the projects we've	-
10:55:19	done and we can start implementing the skills part of our page	-
10:55:24	so let's collapse this just a bit and go to our app control click the skills and	-
10:55:32	we only have three more sections to do skills is going to be the next one	-
10:55:38	inside of our skills we're gonna have some imports and these Imports are going	-
10:55:44	to be almost the same as we had in the work so let's go inside of our work and	-
10:55:50	let's simply import all of these files right here	-
10:55:54	let's go back to skills and then just paste them right here	-
10:55:58	of course we don't need this work.s CSS so essentially what we've just imported	-
10:56:05	is going to be react use State use effect in this case we won't need those	-
10:56:11	icons so we can remove that we're going to use motion and we're going to add one	-
10:56:17	more dependency import react tooltip and that's going to be coming from react	-
10:56:24	Dash tooltip and if I'm not mistaken I don't think	-
10:56:30	we've installed react tooltip as a dependency so let's open up our terminal	-
10:56:35	by going to view and then terminal stop it from running by pressing Ctrl C	-
10:56:39	and then Y and then simply type npm install react Dash tooltip	-
10:56:46	this process took a few seconds and we can immediately run our application by	-
10:56:52	running npm start and there we go we are back we're gonna	-
10:56:58	also use app wrap url4 sanity client and then skills.scss now we can start	-
10:57:06	implementing our skills right here we're going to have a react fragment so let's	-
10:57:12	create it we're going to have an H2 element that's going to have a class	-
10:57:17	name equal to head Dash text and there we can simply say something like skills	-
10:57:26	and experience let's save it and let's scroll down	-
10:57:32	there we go skills and experience now we can go below that H2 and we can	-
10:57:40	create a div this div is going to have a class name	-
10:57:45	equal to app underscore underscore skills Dash	-
10:57:50	container and then inside of there we're gonna	
10:57:53	have a motion div so motion dot div of course we have to add some properties	-
10:58:00	into it this div won't have any properties so	-
10:58:04	let's simply give it a class name equal to app underscore underscore skills Dash	-
10:58:11	list and now we want to map over all of our	
10:58:15	skills so skills dot map but before we do that we of course have	-
10:58:21	to fetch all of our skills from our sanity CMS so we're going to repeat the	-
10:58:26	same process we've done so far when fetching other things such as portfolio	-
10:58:31	items we can go back here and we can copy this use effect to now fetch our	-
10:58:37	skills so let's go here and paste it we're gonna have our query where we're	-
10:58:42	going to fetch experiences so right here instead of work type	-
10:58:48	experiences and then just below we also want to fetch our skills so right here	-
10:58:54	let's type skills and that's going to be query and there simply type skills so in	-
10:59:01	this case we have two different queries and what we have to do now is called	-
10:59:05	client dot fetch query that then we get the data and this is the data for the	-
10:59:10	experiences so what we can do is simply set	
10:59:15	experience and right here we're gonna set data now we can basically copy this	-
10:59:22	thing paste it below but now we'll be fetching	
10:59:25	skills so right here we can say skills query and then instead of set experience	-
10:59:30	we can set skills there we go and the last thing we have to do is of course	-
10:59:36	create a use State field for experience and skills so we can say use state	-
10:59:43	that's going to be experience which is at the start going to be an empty array	-
10:59:48	and we can duplicate that and right here we can type skills as well as the set	-
10:59:55	skills so now we're fetching data that we can Loop over so let's start looping	-
11:00:01	immediately right here we can say skills.map	
11:00:05	in here in the Callback function we're going to get one individual skill every	-
11:00:11	Loop we go over and then for each scale we want to show a motion dot div	-
11:00:18	if this motion div is going to have some properties	
11:00:21	nothing we've never seen so far it's going to be while in view is equal to	-
11:00:27	opacity from an array where we're going to have from 0 to 1.	-
11:00:35	then we're going to also have a transition which is going to have a	-
11:00:39	duration of 0.5 seconds we're going to also have a class name	-
11:00:45	equal to app underscore underscore skills Dash item and also app underscore	-
11:00:52	underscore Flex and finally since We're looping over it	-
11:00:56	we can also provide a key as skill dot name	
11:01:02	in here of course we need to have a skill because We're looping over	-
11:01:06	multiple skills so we get an individual skill right here now inside of our	-
11:01:12	motion div we're gonna have one more normal div and this div is going to have	-
11:01:17	a class name equal to app underscore underscore flex	-
11:01:22	and it's also going to have an inline style of background color is going to be	-
11:01:28	equal to skill dot BG color so we can also dynamically change the color of the	-
11:01:35	skill if we Define that in sanity studio and inside of there we're going to	-
11:01:40	render an image a self-closing tag that's going to have a source	-
11:01:45	URL for remember and then we're going to pass in skill	-
11:01:51	dot icon and all of these properties on a skill like name icon and BJ caller	-
11:01:58	we're going to Define ourselves Insanity Studio or rather we've already defined	-
11:02:04	them when we were creating schemas we also need to provide the alt tag	-
11:02:09	which is simply going to say skill dot name	
11:02:13	there we go and finally below this div that contains this image we're gonna	-
11:02:19	have a P tag that's going to have a class name equal to p dash text and it's	-
11:02:26	simply going to render kill dot name	-
11:02:30	and with that we should be close to done with our skills but of course we cannot	-
11:02:35	yet see how that looks like because we haven't entered anything into sanity	-
11:02:39	Studio so one more time you might already have	
11:02:43	it open but I'm going to repeat the process CD into back insanity and Sanity	-
11:02:50	start that's going to allow you to add more data to it once it loads we can	-
11:02:55	control click it and now we can go under skills	
11:03:00	and create a new skill in this case we can say the skill is react and again if	-
11:03:07	you go under assets you should be able to find a lot of different icons and	-
11:03:13	react is right here so you can right click and reveal in File Explorer from	-
11:03:19	here we can find our react and simply drag and drop it we can leave the BG	-
11:03:24	caller empty because if you don't already put one we're going to choose a	-
11:03:27	default color so let's click publish of course just to have a few more skills we	-
11:03:33	can go ahead and add just a few more something like figma if you're a good	-
11:03:37	designer let's publish it again take a look at how simple the process is we can	-
11:03:43	also add flutter git is also an essential thing so let's add git right	-
11:03:48	here and what would a backend developer be without having node.js skills so	-
11:03:54	let's also enter node.js there we go this should be more than enough for now	-
11:03:59	so now if we go back and reload the page you can see that we have our data ported	-
11:04:06	straight from sanity Studio react node.js figma flutter but of course now	-
11:04:12	is the time to actually style all of these items	-
11:04:16	so in this case before we actually go ahead and add our experiences here let's	-
11:04:20	go ahead and style just these icons so we can go to our skills and we can	-
11:04:26	start styling all the jsx that we already have so let's start with that	-
11:04:31	app underscore underscore skills	
11:04:35	Flex is going to be set to 1 and width is going to be set to 100 percent	-
11:04:41	also Flex Dash direction is going to be set to column that way the title is	-
11:04:47	going to appear above then we can Target dot app underscore underscore skills	-
11:04:52	Dash container let's give it a width of around 80	-
11:04:57	percent and also a margin Dash top of three Ram	-
11:05:02	that's going to push it just a bit to the bottom	-
11:05:05	then let's give it the property display is equal to flex as well as the flex	-
11:05:11	Dash direction is equal to row finally we can also provide a media query so	-
11:05:17	right here media screen and we're going to say and	-
11:05:23	Max Dash width is 900 pixels so this is for devices larger than tablets there	-
11:05:31	we're going to make it a width of a hundred percent and also Flex Dash	-
11:05:35	Direction equal to column so this is for mobile devices larger mobiles and even	-
11:05:41	tablets up to 900 pixels and most importantly we need to Target	-
11:05:46	our that app underscore underscore skills Dash list	-
11:05:51	there we can provide it a flex property equal to one display property equal to	-
11:05:57	flex then we can give it a property of flex wrap is equal to wrap	-
11:06:03	we can also give it a property of justify Dash content is equal to flex	-
11:06:07	Dash start as well as align Dash items is also Flex Dash start let's save it	-
11:06:14	and let's see what exactly are we styling so this is going to be app	-
11:06:18	skills and then list so if you go back right here we have app skills list but	-
11:06:26	yeah I was wondering why the Styles haven't been applying I missed an L	-
11:06:30	right here so as soon as we do that you can notice that now we have some styling	-
11:06:35	applied but of course it's still not looking good so if we go back we can	-
11:06:40	also add a margin Dash right equal to 5 REM and finally we can copy this media	-
11:06:46	query apply it here as well and there we can	
11:06:51	set the margin right to be equal to zero if we are on mobile or tablet devices	-
11:06:56	and of course on mobile or tablet this is something you're gonna do really	-
11:07:00	often is justify content Center and a line Dash items Center because there	-
11:07:07	isn't a lot of horizontal space and finally we're styling each individual	-
11:07:12	skill item by doing app underscore underscore skills Dash item let's first	-
11:07:19	apply a flex Dash Direction equal to column we're going to also apply a text	-
11:07:25	Dash align to be equal to Center let's give it a margin equal to one REM	-
11:07:31	to provide some space around each one let's give it a transition so this	-
11:07:36	transition is going to be the same one we've used so far all 0.3 seconds and is	-
11:07:44	in out now we can Target the div that's inside	-
11:07:48	of this item give it a width of 90 pixels as well as the height of 90	-
11:07:55	pixels as well this is immediately going to collapse	-
11:07:59	all of our divs but of course we also have to give them a border Dash radius	-
11:08:05	of 50 as well as the background Dash color	-
11:08:10	equal to FFF now we're going to have the circles but	-
11:08:16	of course we have to Target the image specifically so IMG and set the width to	-
11:08:23	be equal to 50 percent and height 50 as well and finally we get these nice	-
11:08:31	looking Circle skills let's also provide some hover effect by	-
11:08:36	doing a and right here Colin hover and then on Hover we can	-
11:08:43	apply the Box Shadow 0 0 25 pixels and then the color can be f e f 4 F5	-
11:08:53	this is a really white color and right now we can barely see it it looks like	-
11:08:59	it lights up once you hover over it it's barely noticeable but these things	-
11:09:04	matter when you're creating websites the more subtle the animation is the	-
11:09:08	better it is you don't want to have some flashy animations	-
11:09:12	let's also apply a media query we can copy the one we've had so far	-
11:09:17	and that media query is going to go below our hover there we want to say Min	-
11:09:23	width is going to be 2000 pixels so this is going to be for	-
11:09:28	extra large devices and there we can simply change the width	-
11:09:32	and the height to be 150 pixels instead of the basic 50.	-
11:09:39	that's for large devices and then for mobile devices we can duplicate this one	-
11:09:44	more time and there we can simply turn this back to something like 70. there we	-
11:09:50	go so now if we expand this there we go our skills are here and if	-
11:09:56	we make it a bit smaller everything fits nicely this is looking	-
11:10:01	great finally if we leave this div here and go	
11:10:06	below it then we can Target the paragraph	
11:10:10	and that P tag can have a font weight of 500 as well as the margin Dash top equal	-
11:10:17	to 0.5 Ram if we save that now this is going to be	-
11:10:22	just a bit Bolder so we can see it and we can also provide a media query	-
11:10:27	for that so just outside of this P element we can have a Min width of 2000	-
11:10:33	and there we can say margin is one ram and 2 RAM on left and right for extra	-
11:10:39	large devices inside of it we can also change the P	-
11:10:43	tag just a bit by giving it a margin top one REM	-
11:10:48	I just figured that we need some extra space on the top if we're looking at	-
11:10:52	this on extra large devices and this is going to be it for our skills how simple	-
11:10:57	was it to implement all of this using sanity and then code it out now of	-
11:11:03	course we go to the second part of our skills and experience which is of course	-
11:11:07	the experience so if we go back here to skills we can	-
11:11:11	now implement the jsx code for that we can go below this entire motion div by	-
11:11:17	creating a new motion div so right here motion dot div	-
11:11:23	it's also going to have just a class name equal to app underscore underscore	-
11:11:29	skills Dash EXP as an experience there we can Loop over all of the	-
11:11:36	experiences so that's going to look like this	
11:11:39	experience that works	
11:11:43	and then dot map we want to map over each individual work and we want to	-
11:11:48	return a react fragment for it inside of this react fragment we're	-
11:11:54	going to have a motion dot div that motion div is of course going to	-
11:12:00	have a few properties and we can copy them from here because they're mostly	-
11:12:05	going to be the same so let's paste them here	-
11:12:09	opacity is going to stay the same transition as well class name is going	-
11:12:14	to be a bit different it's going to be app underscore underscore skills Dash	-
11:12:20	EXP Dash work we can also give a data Dash tip	-
11:12:26	property to this motion div and that data tip is useful whenever you	-
11:12:30	have some tool tips if you haven't created tooltips before don't worry	-
11:12:34	you'll see how it looks like soon enough then we can say data Dash 4 and then say	-
11:12:40	work dot name of course there's going to be an equal	-
11:12:45	sign right here and finally we can provide a key which is equal to work dot	-
11:12:51	name now inside of there we want to render an	
11:12:55	H4 element so right here let's say H4	-
11:13:00	and it's going to have a class name equal to bold	-
11:13:05	Dash text and there we can simply render the work name great now below that we're	-
11:13:13	gonna also have a paragraph let's create a p element right here	-
11:13:18	it's going to have a class name equal to p dash text and there we can	-
11:13:25	render the work dot company that we worked for	-
11:13:29	great so now that we have this div we want to be able to hover over it and see	-
11:13:35	more information about it for that reason we're going to create a react	-
11:13:39	tooltip component this is a dependency that we installed	-
11:13:44	and we can simply call it as a component provide a few properties to it and	-
11:13:49	that's going to be it first we need the ID and the ID is going	-
11:13:54	to be equal to work dot name then we need the effect which is going	-
11:13:59	to be simply a string of solid we also need the arrow	-
11:14:05	color which is going to be set to FFF and finally we need a class name which	-
11:14:12	is going to be skills Dash tooltip and inside of there we can render our work	-
11:14:19	dot description or just DSC for short and that's going to be it so now let's	-
11:14:27	go back to sanity content work experience and let's go ahead and	-
11:14:33	add it right here we can enter the name of our	-
11:14:38	experience so let's say front-end developer	
11:14:42	we can say the company let's in this case put Google	-
11:14:47	and the description can be I worked as a front-end developer at Google of course	-
11:14:56	try to be just a bit more creative let's publish it	-
11:15:01	go back to our react application and reload the page it looks like we have	-
11:15:07	some kind of an error at the moment so let's go ahead and go to inspect	-
11:15:11	and go to console looks like the browser is not defined and we're having an error	-
11:15:17	reading the property undefined off map okay so that's under skills line 48.	-
11:15:25	I always like to include these errors in because it can definitely be helpful	-
11:15:30	so now we're looking for experience dot works and this experience is coming from	-
11:15:36	experiences now if we go to our sanity we can notice	
11:15:42	that our experiences are here and not under work experience so rather let's go	-
11:15:47	to experiences and enter the year that we've worked somewhere	-
11:15:52	right here let's say that it was 2020 and there we can add the item at which	-
11:15:58	company did we work at let's say the name is going to be front-end the	-
11:16:02	developer the company is going to be Google and	
11:16:06	description can be I've worked as a front-end developer	-
11:16:13	there we go let's go ahead and publish	-
11:16:17	now you can add multiple experiences for the same year so this is the exact	-
11:16:22	reason why we created it like this let's go back and reload	-
11:16:27	and looks like the error is not going to be just inside of that map looks like we	-
11:16:32	also have some other errors so let's go step by step	-
11:16:36	it's always good whenever you're not sure if you're gonna get some data back	-
11:16:39	to add a question mark so in here we can add a question mark	-
11:16:44	both here as well as here and there we go that fixed the issue	-
11:16:51	so now if we close this and go back we can see that we have our skills but	-
11:16:57	still we cannot find experiences so what we can do is of course we can	-
11:17:03	console log what we get back from our experience	
11:17:07	right here console.log and that is going to be data we can open up the inspect	-
11:17:13	element go to console info reload the page	
11:17:19	and we get an array with one element that has all of our experience	-
11:17:25	that experience is an object that has the works array inside of it and there	-
11:17:31	we have all of the information so if you're looking at this correctly	-
11:17:36	that experience is set up here and then we want to do experience dot works and	-
11:17:43	then we want to map over that array and that looks good to me so if you reload	-
11:17:48	the page one more time I really think we shouldn't have any problems	-
11:17:52	let's go ahead and quit mobile view go down	
11:17:56	and I still cannot see it it's actually fun that we've been quoting this app for	-
11:18:01	such a long time and this is the first error that occurred so that's actually	-
11:18:06	really really good and I always like to include these errors in so let's go	-
11:18:11	ahead and figure out the error together I'm going to show you how I would solve	-
11:18:15	this in real time and I'm also going to show you a cool	-
11:18:19	trick have you ever wondered if you can add console logs inside of your jsx and	-
11:18:25	you can you can simply add a console log right here inside of the jsx that way	-
11:18:32	we're gonna know how does the experience dot Works looks right here before it	-
11:18:37	becomes a login also we can add a string saying	-
11:18:42	here that we know that we are referring to this specific console log	-
11:18:47	now if we expand this you can see this is really interesting we do get it above	-
11:18:53	but here it is on the find so that is definitely the issue we're having so	-
11:18:59	what is the reason that we have our data above but we don't have it here	-
11:19:05	well if we go to our experience we can see that we're populating it here but it	-
11:19:12	is an array so we have to Loop over all of our experiences as well because the	-
11:19:18	objects in this array represent years and every single year can have multiple	-
11:19:23	experiences so to fix the issue we can go back to	
11:19:28	rjsx and instead of immediately looping over experience that works what we can	-
11:19:34	do is first Loop over only over the experience that way we're going to get	-
11:19:41	different years let me show you what I mean for now I'm going to comment out	-
11:19:46	this entire jsx block of code and move it one line below so that we don't have	-
11:19:52	an issue with the compiler now inside of here we can actually render just the	-
11:19:57	work Dot and let's see what do we have in the work let's do year	-
11:20:03	there we go so now you can see that this work actually exists and it has a year	-
11:20:09	2020. now we can go ahead and create one more year so if we go to experiences and	-
11:20:16	create a new year 2021 and there we worked as a backend	-
11:20:21	developer at let's say Facebook or now it's meta	
11:20:26	so let's say meta and description can be I worked with	-
11:20:32	node.js and VR and let's go ahead and publish that	-
11:20:38	so now if we reload the page you can notice 2020 and 2021 and inside of there	-
11:20:45	we also have a list of all of the works so we need to have a nested map	-
11:20:51	let's go ahead and fix that we're going to keep this commented down	-
11:20:56	below because we need to add one more div right here a motion dot div	-
11:21:03	and this motion div is going to have just two properties	-
11:21:07	class name equal to app underscore underscore	-
11:21:12	skills Dash EXP Dash item and it's also going to have a key equal	-
11:21:19	to experience dot year to make it unique there we can simply render out a div	-
11:21:28	and that div is going to have a class name equal to app	-
11:21:33	underscore underscore skills Dash EXP Dash year	-
11:21:39	the only thing we're going to have there is going to be a paragraph that's going	-
11:21:43	to have a class name equal to bold Dash text and it's going to render experience	-
11:21:50	dot year of course now we're talking about an	-
11:21:54	experience and not work so now if we save that you can see we have 2020 and	-
11:22:00	2021 and just below that div now is the time	
11:22:05	that we create another motion dot div that div is going to have a class name	-
11:22:12	equal to app underscore underscore skills Dash EXP Dash works and then	-
11:22:20	finally inside of there we can do our nested map so we're first looping over	-
11:22:25	the years and then We're looping over the experiences for each year so we can	-
11:22:30	say experience dot Works dot map and then we get each individual work	-
11:22:37	there we go now what we can do is uncomment this big block of code and put	-
11:22:43	it back in its place inside of our second map	-
11:22:48	there we go Hopefully this wasn't so weird and it	-
11:22:53	still made sense if you got lost at the time when we made this bug definitely	-
11:22:58	make sure to visit the source code there's going to be an entire finished	-
11:23:02	skills.jsx file so you can simply copy and paste it and continue with the video	-
11:23:07	but I also hope that you were able to go through this bug with me and fix it	-
11:23:12	together and there we go 2020 front-end developer Google 2021 back-end developer	-
11:23:19	at meta this is great and take a look at this if we hover we	-
11:23:25	get this nice tooltip so now we have more information on Hover	-
11:23:30	of course now is the time that we style this better so let's jump straight into	-
11:23:36	skills.scss and let's continue with the styling to style our experiences we can	-
11:23:42	Target the dot app underscore underscore skills Dash EXP let's give it a flex	-
11:23:48	equal to one as well as the display equal to flex	-
11:23:53	justify Dash content can be Flex Dash start as well as a line Dash items also	-
11:24:01	Flex Dash start Flex Dash direction is going to be	-
11:24:06	column because we want to show one experience on top of another	-
11:24:11	finally we can also add a media query with the max width of 900 I think we	-
11:24:17	already had it somewhere right here we can paste it below and there we can	-
11:24:23	simply apply a margin Dash top to REM if we are on devices with the max	-
11:24:30	width of 900 pixels then finally we can Target each individual experience item	-
11:24:37	by saying that app underscore underscore skills Dash EXP Dash item	-
11:24:45	let's give it a width off 100 percent we can give it a display is equal to	-
11:24:51	flex Dash direction is going to be set to row	
11:24:56	justify Dash content is going to be Flex start as well as the Align Dash items is	-
11:25:02	going to be Flex start finally margin can be one REM on top and	-
11:25:06	bottom and zero on left and right now we can style our works by saying dot	-
11:25:13	app underscore underscore skills Dash EXP Dash works	-
11:25:19	let's give it a flex is equal to one and then we can Target each individual	-
11:25:24	work dot app underscore unders for skills Dash EXP Dash work	-
11:25:31	let's set a display is equal to flex there we go you can notice that these	-
11:25:37	now go in a row but we're going to soon change it to display or rather Flex Dash	-
11:25:43	direction is going to be column there we go I'm going to expand this	-
11:25:49	right here so we can see it at the same time	
11:25:52	and then let's also give it a Justified Dash content equal to flex start as well	-
11:25:58	as the Align items equal to flex Dash start	
11:26:02	let's also give it a margin Dash bottom of one REM	-
11:26:08	and let's make it a cursor pointer so they know that they can hover there we	-
11:26:13	go let's target this H4 specifically and	
11:26:18	give it a font weight of 500. there we go and let's now Target the P	-
11:26:24	specifically give it a fun Dash weight of 400	
11:26:30	change the color to VAR Dash the hash gray Dash color	-
11:26:36	and finally add a margin Dash top of 5 pixels	
11:26:41	there we go this is still not looking good because we have to style these	-
11:26:46	years so let's go outside of all of our curly braces and say that app underscore	-
11:26:52	underscore skills Dash EXP Dash year let's give it a	-
11:26:58	margin Dash right of 3 RAM and finally let's target the P tag	-
11:27:04	inside of it give it a font weight of 800 to make it bold	-
11:27:10	as well as the color is equal to VAR not gray color but rather secondary color	-
11:27:18	now it has that bluish color and let's also do a media query for	-
11:27:24	mobile devices add media screen and Max Dash width is going to be	-
11:27:32	450 pixels that's only for mobile devices let's give it a margin Dash	-
11:27:38	right of one ram of course we're missing screen here	-
11:27:43	so if we fix that now you can see that we have some nice spacing here and the	-
11:27:49	last thing we have to style is going to be the stool tip	-
11:27:52	so what we can do about the tooltip we can say dot skills Dash tooltip	-
11:27:59	and in here let's increase the max Dash width of the tooltip to 300 pixels	-
11:28:06	there we go and you're gonna notice that this style	-
11:28:10	is not going to be applied so if you do something like background and try to	-
11:28:14	make a background color completely White you're going to notice that it's not	-
11:28:19	gonna work it's still black and this is something they're going to come across	-
11:28:23	when you want to style specific dependencies or specific packages it's	-
11:28:28	not going to be as easy as you thought so I figured out that we have to do	-
11:28:34	something that's not really recommended and that is adding importance to the end	-
11:28:39	of every CSS line I don't want you to type all of this out	-
11:28:44	and it's usually not a good practice but in this case it worked like a charm so	-
11:28:49	again the skills.scss file is going to be down in the description alongside all	-
11:28:54	the other files in the source code so simply paste this and then it's going to	-
11:28:59	look like this this is much better	-
11:29:02	of course right now we're looking at it on a really small device so as soon as	-
11:29:07	we expand it you're gonna notice this looks much better but you can also	-
11:29:12	notice that this section is taking a hundred percent of the space this one as	-
11:29:16	well as well as this one and this one not so much we forgot to	-
11:29:23	wrap our component with the app wrap so let's do that right away app wrap we	-
11:29:29	wrap it and then that's going to be skills let's save it	-
11:29:34	and instantly that comes in the middle of the screen and now we have our skills	-
11:29:39	on the left side as well as our experience on the right side this is	-
11:29:45	looking great let's try to add one more experience under 2020 for example so if	-
11:29:51	we go here go under 2020 and add item let's say that you became a blockchain	-
11:29:57	developer even before it became cool and let's say you became a blockchain	-
11:30:02	developer at something like let's still do meta I think it was Facebook in 2021	-
11:30:09	and then that's going to be description I develop in solidity	-
11:30:14	which is a programming language for ethereum	
11:30:18	let's publish and if we reload the page	-
11:30:22	there we go blockchain developer at Facebook and now we're done with the	-
11:30:28	skills and experience section as well only two more sections to go the	-
11:30:34	testimonial and the footer which acts as a contact form	-
11:30:38	now if we scroll we can see that we have quite a lot of cool sections but I have	-
11:30:43	one problem with that we don't have a lot of good animations because once	-
11:30:48	these things animate once nothing is going to happen so we can create another	-
11:30:53	higher order component but this time we're going to wrap every single section	-
11:30:59	with a motion div so when we scroll these sections are going to animate	-
11:31:04	let's go ahead and do that right away we can go inside of our wrapper and	-
11:31:11	there we can create a new component called motion wrap dot JS there we can	-
11:31:18	import react from react as well as import motion	-
11:31:24	from motion or rather frame or motion then we can create a component I can do	-
11:31:31	an rafce and this component is going to accept a	-
11:31:36	component as its first parameter and it's also going to accept class names as	-
11:31:42	the second one because we can change this dynamically as the last function	-
11:31:46	it's also going to return a higher order component that's going to look like this	-
11:31:52	the only thing that we're going to return here is going to be a motion div	-
11:31:57	so right here motion dot div that motion div is going to have the while in View	-
11:32:04	Property and while it is in view we're going to	
11:32:08	change the opacity from 0 to 1 but we can add one extra step 0 0 1	-
11:32:15	and then we can add the y-axis which is going to be an array of	-
11:32:21	150 and then zero so it's slowly going to animate in and the opacity is going	-
11:32:28	to be 1 only at the last one this whole transition is going to last	-
11:32:34	duration 0.5 seconds	
11:32:40	and finally the class name is going to be dynamic	-
11:32:45	so a template string class names	-
11:32:48	and then also app underscore underscore Flex	
11:32:53	of course the most important thing is to render our component inside of it	-
11:32:58	because this is just a wrapper and we still want to show everything else	-
11:33:03	now we can go to our second section which is the about section right here so	-
11:33:10	let's find the component for the about and we can first import our motion wrap	-
11:33:17	right here but of course remember we also have to export it so going back to	-
11:33:22	wrapper in the index we can simply say export default as motion wrap and that	-
11:33:30	is coming from that slash motion wrap now in the about alongside wrapping our	-
11:33:38	application with the app wrap we can also wrap it with a motion wrap and	-
11:33:44	that's going to look like this so first we have our app wrap and then	-
11:33:50	the actual component is also going to be wrapped in a motion wrap like this	-
11:33:57	and we're going to provide it an extra class name app underscore underscore	-
11:34:01	about then we can say comma about and provide	
11:34:06	one final class app underscore underscore white b g	-
11:34:12	that means that we want to give it a white background because notice now we	-
11:34:17	have white and then we have gray it wouldn't be good otherwise if the entire	-
11:34:21	website was just this grayish bluish color	
11:34:25	so now we can copy this thing and then go to our work section so let's	-
11:34:32	go back to work right here and let's simply paste what we copied we	-
11:34:38	of course have to import motion wrap and we can do that by pressing Ctrl space	-
11:34:42	and clicking right here if that didn't Auto Import it for you feel free to	-
11:34:47	manually import it at the top and then right here we just have to	-
11:34:51	change this about to work this here is going to be app underscore underscore	-
11:34:57	work right here we can also set the ID of the	
11:35:01	section to work and this is going to be primary	
11:35:04	BG there we go let's save it and as you can	
11:35:09	see we have one issue here and that issue is that in here we need an S so	-
11:35:15	this is going to be works this is going to make everything work finally we have	-
11:35:20	to change the color of this section and we can do that by going to skills and	-
11:35:25	one more time we can paste what we copied	
11:35:28	import the motion wrap right here call skills	-
11:35:34	same thing here app underscore underscore skills	-
11:35:38	write skills right here and that's going to be white BG so now we have this nice	-
11:35:44	combination of a primary color white primary color and then white again so we	-
11:35:51	are really differentiating these sections and making each one stand out	-
11:35:56	since this is now white we really do need to add a background color to each	-
11:36:01	one of these circles so let's do just that I'm going to go to JSM portfolio	-
11:36:07	and then we can go to skills let's go to node.js and then we can go	-
11:36:13	to our index.css and find a nice color we want to use for example let's try	-
11:36:19	with this blue one simply paste it here click publish	-
11:36:24	go back to our application and reload and there we go this is a bit too strong	-
11:36:30	of a color so let's choose a lighter color something like EDF to f8 we can	-
11:36:36	copy it paste it here and click publish one more time	-
11:36:41	now if we go back and reload you can notice that we have this nice gray	-
11:36:46	Circle let's go ahead and apply that color to all of our skills flutter as	-
11:36:52	well publish and the same thing goes for	
11:36:56	figma as well as react this just shows you	
11:37:01	that it's incredibly easy to update things not just add them using sanity so	-
11:37:07	now if we go back reload the page you can see that we have these nice circles	-
11:37:13	looking great so now finally we can move to the next	-
11:37:18	section which is going to be testimonial let's go right here and now we already	-
11:37:24	know that we're going to use most of the things that we already use in the skills	-
11:37:28	section because we have to fetch some data from sanity such as skills and	-
11:37:32	experiences we also have to wrap our component so let's go ahead and open up	-
11:37:37	our Visual Studio code to its entirety and let's put our skills	-
11:37:42	side by side with the testimonial because there's definitely going to be	-
11:37:47	some stuff that's going to be similar so first of all let's copy our motion	-
11:37:52	paste it there we're gonna also need to import some icons so right here we can	-
11:37:58	say import hi Chevron	
11:38:02	and that's going to be left as well as h i Chevron and that's going to be right	-
11:38:08	as well coming from react Dash icons forward slash h i we're going to also	-
11:38:15	need the app wrap as well as the URL for and the client so we can copy and paste	-
11:38:21	those two lines as well and I'm not sure if you've noticed so	-
11:38:25	far I always like to put one extra line between all of the external Imports to	-
11:38:30	divide them from the internal Imports that are inside of our file system	-
11:38:35	we're gonna also need to import use State and use effect Hooks and we can	-
11:38:40	copy the experience and the skills as well	
11:38:43	but this time it's not going to be experience and skills rather it's going	-
11:38:48	to be brands and set brands as well as the testimonials	-
11:38:55	and set testimonials so we can put that here instead of the set skills	-
11:39:01	we also need to have a state for the index of the current testimonial we are	-
11:39:07	currently viewing so right here that's going to be current	-
11:39:11	index as well as the Set current and that's going to be index there we go at	-
11:39:19	the start that's going to be set to 0. next we're going to have our use effect	-
11:39:25	and the use effect is going to be quite similar so we can paste it right here	-
11:39:30	and instead of fetching experiences and skills we can fetch testimonials	-
11:39:35	and Brands there instead of simply saying set experience we're going to	-
11:39:41	remove this console log and we're going to say set testimonials	-
11:39:46	and for the bottom one we can rename that to Brands query	-
11:39:51	there we're simply going to set brands so now we're fetching all of the data	-
11:39:58	from sanity Studio of course this is where our jsx is going	-
11:40:03	to go but we can also copy all of our higher order components so right here	-
11:40:09	that's going to be testimonial as well as the app underscore	-
11:40:15	testimonial the ID is going to be testimonial one more time and in this	-
11:40:21	case we want to have a primary background color so we can have primary	-
11:40:26	BG so now let's close our skills put this	
11:40:30	side by side with the editor and let's see how does it look like okay just an	-
11:40:36	empty page that has testimonial written right here of course now is the time	-
11:40:41	that we coded out so let's go ahead and get started first we want to have an	-
11:40:47	empty react fragment inside of there we need to have a	-
11:40:51	dynamic code block that's going to check if testimonials exist and we can do that	-
11:40:57	by saying if testimonial is that length if there is length they definitely need	-
11:41:02	to exist so if they do exist then we're going to	-
11:41:05	render a react fragment and inside of that react fragment we're	-
11:41:10	going to render a div that div is going to have a class name	-
11:41:15	equal to app underscore underscore testimonial	-
11:41:20	Dash item as well as the app underscore underscore Flex	-
11:41:25	inside of there we also need to have an IMG	
11:41:29	with a source url4 testimonials and we need to get the	-
11:41:35	current index of a specific testimonial right here more specifically we need to	-
11:41:41	get the image URL imgurl of that specific testimonial	-
11:41:47	and for the alt name we can simply use testimonial	
11:41:53	there we go so of course this is not going to work now because we don't have	-
11:41:57	our testimonials but now might be a good time to add some Insanity Studio	-
11:42:03	so if we go to our testimonials let's go ahead and add one the name is going to	-
11:42:09	be Sarah the company is going to be let's say Netflix and right here we need	-
11:42:16	to enter Sarah's image but it looks like Sarah is not in the assets so this is a	-
11:42:22	time where we would go on LinkedIn and you would take Sarah's photo but in this	-
11:42:26	case let's say that Sarah is really good at CSS design so we're going to use CSS	-
11:42:31	logo for her head and the feedback is going to be Mikhail	-
11:42:37	is on awesome developer there we go and publish we already had one testimonial	-
11:42:44	from before from Michael from Google and let's say our Michael is like HTML great	-
11:42:50	job would recommend let's publish that as well great so now if we go back to	-
11:42:56	our react application reload the page and scroll down you're gonna notice that	-
11:43:01	we have just a big CSS logo so now how are we going to style that	-
11:43:07	CSS logo well of course that's not just a logo it's going to be the entire	-
11:43:13	testimonial message so let's add a div with a class name	-
11:43:19	equal to app underscore underscore testimonial	
11:43:23	and dash content inside of there let's add a P tag	-
11:43:29	that's going to be of a class name equal to	
11:43:33	p dash text and there we can also render testimonials	
11:43:40	and then current index of course this time we don't want the	-
11:43:45	image URL rather we want dot feedback that the person left	-
11:43:50	Mikhail is an awesome developer great now you can notice that many times	-
11:43:56	you're using this long line right here testimonials current index dot something	-
11:44:01	whenever you notice that you're reusing something quite a lot definitely make	-
11:44:06	sure to copy it get it out right here and then say const	-
11:44:11	let's do test as in short for testimonial and paste it here	-
11:44:16	then now you can just use every time test dot something and it's going to	-
11:44:22	work the same as it worked right here that's great below RP tag we're gonna	-
11:44:28	have a div and inside of that div we're going to have an H4 with a class name	-
11:44:34	equal to bold Dash text and there we're simply going to run their test	-
11:44:40	dot name okay Sarah posted this and we can duplicate this	-
11:44:46	change this to H5 change the class name to P Dash text and	-
11:44:53	finally test dot company so that we know which company Sarah is from and that is	-
11:44:59	Netflix great so this was our first div and just below	-
11:45:04	that we're gonna have one more div this div is going to allow us to move	-
11:45:09	across different testimonials so it's going to have a class name equal to app	-
11:45:15	underscore underscore testimonial Dash btns and also app underscore	-
11:45:22	underscore Flex inside of there we're gonna have a div	-
11:45:27	that div is going to have a class name app underscore underscore flex and it's	-
11:45:33	also going to have an on click there we're going to call a callback	-
11:45:37	function and then that callback function is going	
11:45:41	to call the handle click function which we need to create to that handle click	-
11:45:47	function we have to provide the number of the testimonial we want to see and	-
11:45:51	since this is going to be a back arrow we can do current index	-
11:45:56	minus one but what if we're already on the first index then we cannot go back	-
11:46:02	so what we can say if the current index is triple equal to zero then we're going	-
11:46:08	to move to testimonials dot length minus one so we're going to	-
11:46:14	move to the last testimonial and if we're not on the first one that means	-
11:46:19	that we can go back so it's going to be current index -1 and then inside of	-
11:46:24	there we can simply render hi Chevron and this is going to be left now we can	-
11:46:30	duplicate this div below and right here this is going to be just	-
11:46:35	a bit different we're going to check if the current	-
11:46:38	index is triple equal to testimonials	
11:46:42	dot length minus one so if we are currently on the last index then we want	-
11:46:49	to go to the first index so that's going to be right here	-
11:46:54	zero and if you're not on the last we simply	
11:46:58	want to say current index plus one and of course we have to create our handle	-
11:47:03	click function so just at the top right here	-
11:47:08	we can say const handle click is going to be equal to it's going to	-
11:47:14	accept an index and we can say Set current index	-
11:47:20	is going to be equal to index that's all that we have to do and now we have those	-
11:47:26	two icons and we can move around of course this is going to be the right	-
11:47:31	icon there we go so now we have our Michael from Google create job would	-
11:47:36	recommend and also our Sarah from Netflix	
11:47:40	now below this entire testimonials that length so below here we're going to	-
11:47:46	create one more div and this div is going to have a class name equal to app	-
11:47:52	underscore underscore testimonials Dash Brands and then app underscore	-
11:47:57	underscore Flex there we want to Loop over the brands so	-
11:48:03	brands.map we get an individual brand and then we want to return	-
11:48:09	emotion.div for that specific brand our motion is going to have some frame or	-
11:48:15	motion properties such as while in view we want to change the opacity	-
11:48:20	from zero to one	-
11:48:24	then the transition is going to last the duration of 0.5 seconds	-
11:48:33	and the type is going to be set to tween and finally since we're mapping over we	-
11:48:39	can provide a key equal to Brand dot underscore ID inside of there we simply	-
11:48:46	want to render the brand image so we can say IMG SRC	-
11:48:52	URL for brand Dot imgurl and we can also provide the alt tag	-
11:49:02	which is going to be brand dot name I'm missing an extra curly brace here	-
11:49:09	and I think this is going to be it so far we haven't added Our Brands so if	-
11:49:14	we go here and add a new brand let's go ahead and simply drag and drop	-
11:49:19	the brand image so in here you can add the logos of the	-
11:49:24	companies you worked for so let's say we worked for New Balance	-
11:49:28	New Balance let's add a few more something like let's do Skype	-
11:49:35	let's also do Spotify and let's also add Bolt	-
11:49:42	there we go so now we have four different companies	-
11:49:47	let's go back to our react application and reload the page	-
11:49:52	there we go huge logos are appearing right here of course we have to style	-
11:49:59	them to make them smaller so now let's go back and let's focus on styling our	-
11:50:05	testimonial page we can do that by going to testimonial.scss	-
11:50:11	and since this is looking awful right now we can immediately focus on styling	-
11:50:17	this SVG image for the brand that way we don't have to look at those	-
11:50:22	huge ass logos let's start with DOT app underscore underscore testimonial Dash	-
11:50:28	brands let's set the width to be 80 percent	
11:50:34	as well as the flex Dash wrap set to crap and the margin Dash top set to 2	-
11:50:40	RAM this is not going to change anything yet	
11:50:44	but as we target the inner div we can set the width of the inner div to 150	-
11:50:50	pixels we can also give it a margin of 1.5 gram	
11:50:57	inside of this div let's target our image and give it a width of 100 percent	-
11:51:05	like this we can also set the height to be equal	-
11:51:09	to auto and the object fit can be set to cover	-
11:51:14	we can also apply a filter equal to gray scale and then one so this is going to	-
11:51:20	make the logos appear dark at the start but for some reason looks like our	-
11:51:26	styles are not getting applied that app underscore underscore testimonial Dash	-
11:51:31	Brands so let's see if this is how we called it right here	-
11:51:35	looks like I'm missing an I here and I have an extra s so if I fix this you can	-
11:51:40	see that now our logos are looking Sharp now of course they're not going to stay	-
11:51:46	grayed out forever below this image we can say and	-
11:51:51	hover IMG	
11:51:54	and then the filter is going to be grayscale zero this is an amazing way to	-
11:52:00	provide color on Hover looking great below our hover we can also apply a few	-
11:52:07	media queries like add media screen and Min width is going to be 2 000 pixels so	-
11:52:16	let's change this to min there we can increase the width of the	-
11:52:20	image just a bit to 210 pixels and increase the margin to be equal to 2	-
11:52:27	RAM on the other hand we'll have to make	
11:52:30	this a lot smaller for mobile devices where the max width is going to be	-
11:52:35	around 450 pixels there the web is going to be 120 pixels	-
11:52:42	and margin is going to be one ram finally we can copy this media query go	-
11:52:48	below this gorilla brace right here and there we want to set the width to be	-
11:52:53	equal to 100 percent and this is going to be for devices of the max width up to	-
11:53:00	800. so if we are on tablet devices or larger	
11:53:04	mobile phones then we want this section to take 100 of the screen	-
11:53:10	of course now we are yet to style our main part which is the testimonial let's	-
11:53:15	start by scrolling above and just above our app testimonial Brands we can add	-
11:53:21	that app underscore underscore testimonial our Flex is going to be set	-
11:53:26	to 1 the width is going to be set to 100	-
11:53:30	percent and the flex Dash direction is going to be set to column	-
11:53:36	now our testimonials are going to go on top	
11:53:39	then we can change the dot app underscore underscore testimonial and	-
11:53:44	then Dash item let's change the width to be 60 percent	-
11:53:49	we're going to set a Min height of 320 pixels this is going to make it so that	-
11:53:56	once we move through different testimonials the height doesn't change	-
11:53:59	no matter how much text there is let's also apply a background Dash color	-
11:54:06	of VAR dash dash white and then Dash color	
11:54:12	there we go we need to make this a display equal to	-
11:54:17	flex of course add a semicolon here and then we need to add a padding of to	-
11:54:24	ram a border Dash radius of 15 pixels is	
11:54:29	going to help just a bit to round the corners	
11:54:33	and let's add a box Dash Shadow 0 0 30 pixels	-
11:54:39	rgba 0 0 and then 0.1 that's going to make it float in the air	-
11:54:48	finally let's add a transition and our transition is going to be all	-
11:54:53	0.3 seconds is in out so finally we can style this image by saying IMG width is	-
11:55:03	going to be 100 and the height is going to be 100 as well	-
11:55:09	border radius is going to be 50 to make it rounded	-
11:55:15	and object Dash fit is going to be cover then below this image we want to apply	-
11:55:21	some media queries so let's say add media	
11:55:25	screen and Min Dash width is 2000 pixels	
11:55:30	there we can set the Min height to be a bit higher like 450 pixels as well as	-
11:55:37	the image to have a width of 150 by height 150	-
11:55:44	pixels as well this is for extra large devices and	-
11:55:48	finally we need two more media queries so add media	-
11:55:53	screen and Max Dash width that's going to be 850 pixels for tablets and mobile	-
11:56:01	devices in there we want to have a width set to 100 percent because for smaller	-
11:56:08	devices we want this testimonial to take the entirety of the screen	-
11:56:13	and finally the last media query is going to say at media screen and Max	-
11:56:19	with 600 pixels there we simply want to change the flex	-
11:56:25	Dash direction to be column because there is no more horizontal space so if	-
11:56:30	we go below 600 you can see this comes below the icon great	-
11:56:36	so of course our content still isn't styled so what we can do is we can	-
11:56:42	Target the dot app underscore underscore testimonial Dash content	-
11:56:48	we can set the flex to be equal to one the height to be equal to 100 percent	-
11:56:54	in here I can remove this Auto padding can be set to zero on top and	-
11:57:00	bottom and two RAM on left and right and we can text the line	-
11:57:05	left finally we want to change the display to	
11:57:09	be equal to flex Dash direction to be set to column	-
11:57:15	justify Dash content to be set to space Dash around	-
11:57:20	and finally align Dash items to be set to flex Dash start	-
11:57:27	okay so now this is already looked just a bit more like it but it's still not	-
11:57:32	even close to what we want to have at the end	-
11:57:35	let's change our P tag by saying p font Dash size of 1.25 Ram to make it a	-
11:57:45	bit bigger let's also change the line Dash height	-
11:57:49	to something like 2 RAM we can change the color to be equal to	-
11:57:54	VAR and this is going to be black color and we can also change the font Dash	-
11:58:00	family to be VAR and then Nash Dash font Dash base	-
11:58:07	after that we want to Target our H4 our H4 is going to have a font Dash	-
11:58:13	weight of 600. and the color is going to be equal to	-
11:58:19	VAR and then dash dash secondary Dash color	
11:58:25	and let's also apply a bit of margin more specifically margin Dash top of 2	-
11:58:32	RAM there we go last things last we have to	
11:58:37	apply our H5 so right here our H5 is going to have a font weight of 400. it's	-
11:58:45	going to have a color equal to VAR dash dash gray Dash color	-
11:58:50	and the margin top is going to be set to 5 pixels	-
11:58:55	now this profile photo still seems quite too big for me so let's see if we maybe	-
11:59:01	mess something up with the image and it looks like we did hey there sorry	-
